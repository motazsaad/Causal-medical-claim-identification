(Lovaza)
I'm thinking about trying the high omega-3 / lower omega-6 diet thing, and it seemed like fish oils were more promising than plant-based omega-3 sources (like flax.) 

The data on this isn't amazing, but it's worth a shot (and I'm wondering if a lot of the inconsistent results might boil down to study participants eating too much omega-6.)

However, there's a lot of potential concerns with oily fish, especially if you already have significant peripheral neuropathy like I do. I was looking at smaller fish (anchovies & sardines) to avoid heavy metals, but apparently these fish are sometimes contaminated with [domoic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domoic_acid) (which among other things can cause neuronal damage, resulting in long term neuropathy.) Krill has its own potential issues lurking as well.

However! In looking at all of this I stumbled on some prescription fish oils, which I didn't realize was a thing. They're actually purified and synthetically altered versions of fish oils, and they're prescribed for cardiac patients with high triglycerides. Several have been discontinued and one of them (Vascepa) is expensive... but it looks like Lovaza is a bit under $30 a month [through Goodrx](https://www.goodrx.com/lovaza). [One study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23918873/) noted that ""Lovaza® was also shown to reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-"" (The later two are classic targets for anti-RA biologic DMARDs).

Plus, at a glance it seems like there are at least a few [anecdotal reports](https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/articles/lovaza-for-high-triglycerides-eased-joint-pain) of it helping joint pain.

The only slightly tricky part is getting an off-label prescription (since my triglycerides are fine), but that might not be too hard. The side effect profile of Lovaza seems very mild indeed. Certainly it seems much safer to my eyes than gambling with fish oils (which could contain many different things that could aggravate my neuropathic symptoms.)  

It's an unproven long shot, obviously not a replacement for proven DMARDs, but given the modest potential downside I think it's worth a shot.

EDIT: I just raised the quantities on GoodRX and it's even cheaper if you buy 3 months at a time, closer to $0.65 per day than $1 per day. (Note GoodRX is free to use, no insurance required though you'd still need the script.)"

My bloods are all normal and lupus band test is negative on biopsy but pathologist says it looks like lupus. I have checked out online photos and to me it absolutely looks like tumid lupus along with some other features of the pathology which fit this diagnosis. 

I am currently trying topical steroids to see if they are enough (along with vitamin d and fish oil) but I think I will need to try hydroxychloroquine soon which is what my dermatologist is suggesting next.

Is there a diet that substantially helped with symptoms? I know it cant take it away but Im willing to try and change to anything if it alleviates even a small amount of it.

Are there other life changes or adjustments you made that have been worth the effort? I have spoken with quite a few people that deal with autoimmune disorders but no one that specifically had Lupus.

Before starting benlysta I was on a round of prednisone and did topicals for my rash and it cleared up some.  discontinued the steroids just prior to my covid booster shot and 2 weeks after that started the benlysta.

My grandmother had lupus and was diagnosed on her deathbed. She suffered a 3 hour seizure, her brain had shrunk and she had cirrhosis of the liver. Years prior to this she would swell up huge in her ankles and knees and feet, she also had the butterfly rash. When telling the doctor this she told me ""those aren't usual lupus symptoms, swelling was probably from the cirrhosis of liver"", which is true but clearly that all happened from untreated lupus!!!! In fact the doctor who diagnosed me is the one who diagnosed my grandmother. Anyway, she had also told me my hands were eczema (could be but I've never had eczema and this had gotten progressively worse as my symptoms got worse earlier in the year). I asked her if it's not lupus what could this be and she said probably just damaged knee, didn't have any other ideas.i could tell she didn't believe me, thought I was over exaggerating.  WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER SYMPTOMS? Does my meniscus affect everything else I'm experiencing???? Ugh. I am just frustrated and don't know what to do.

Hello all!

Ive been getting rashes on my face and hands in the last month and had some joint pain recently so Im getting into thinking that maybe Ive got lupus, did some tests ANA was borderline positive, the other were negative; waiting for an appointment with the PCP. I think that the rash on my face is malar however, unlike what Ive read here where people say it comes and goes, mine is constant..I have non-itchy patches of red on my forehead, cheeks and chin which are constantly there.

The skin is hot to touch (with the exception of sometimes the nose being cold but still red and the worse thing is  twice a day Id get a sort of hot flush on my face and the red will extend even more down the cheeks and up to the temples and my eyebrows. No amount of make up can hide it, let alone appease the burning feeling Im feeling. It lasts for a couple of hours.. I cant seem to pinpoint whats causing the flush. In addition to that I feel like my head is on fire even though I dont have temperature and my ears are burning all the time.. Anyone can relate to this? I know I'm getting ahead of myself but Im afraid that if the rash is so intensive, maybe it wont be alleviated with meds if I get them prescribed.. I'm attaching a picture of the rash on my forehead.

So last Saturday I started slightly feeling sick, Sunday I got a positive rapid test. By Monday I was feeling absolutely awful. My chest felt like I had ants crawling in my lungs, headache, coughing like crazy, severe fatigue, muscle aches, and sore throat. 

Tuesday I got a positive PCR done and was booked in for Sotrovimab because I take Simponi for my UC. 

Wednesday afternoon I went in for my infusion. It takes two hours, one for the actual IV treatment, and then they keep you for an hour to make sure you dont have any reaction. Its imperative that you get it within 5 days of symptom onset, otherwise its too late for it to work, I guess. 

Anyways, Im about 36 hours in now and honestly feeling pretty great considering. I still feel a bit more tired than usual, and my throat still hurts, but my cough is almost completely gone, my muscle aches and a headache are gone, and my lungs dont feel itchy anymore.

Im a 33 year old male and Ive had Crohns for ten years, five of which Ive been in endoscopic remission due to humira  (still sometimes feels like I have issues, but doctors always say it looks squeaky clean in there). For better or worse, my disease has always been located near the end of the colon so its hard for me to know if Im in a flare or if I have a hemorrhoid. 

Anyway, Ive been suffering from a chronic mononucleosis infection for the past four months and its completely wrecked my life. I used to be really active and social, but I havent worked out in months and havent done anything social outside of the house either. Ive been limping by at work, but its a struggle.

Im seriously considering stopping humira to help aide my recovery, since there is no sign at all that Im recovering. However, my doctor warns me that if I go off I could develop antibodies to the drug and it will be less effective. It sure seems like a convenient thing for a pharmaceutical company to claim you cant ever go off their drug, so my prior is that these claims are overblown. After having both opiates and acutane pushed on me as a 14 year old kid, Im pretty skeptical of any claim about a drug, especially when it so clearly benefits AbbVie.

Curious if anyone has been in a similar situation before. Thanks!

UPDATE: I ended up going off Humira, and after about 6-8 weeks I started feeling remarkably better! I got additional blood work done confirming there is still some EBV left, but Im now producing a ton of antibodies to fight off the infection. Id say I have a little inflammation in rectum but I can live with it until I fully recover."

The thing is, in the last year I have noticed that I sometimes just randomly (or not so randomly, maybe it is stress-related, too) get a low-grade fever (my body temperature is generally low, but I recently get days where it rises from 96.9 to 98.6). When this happens I also feel extremely fatigued, like I am going to get sick with the flu, my body feels heavy and aches. And my chest hurts sharply when I inhale.

Of course, I know this can be a touchy subject depending on what country you live in and the fact that there is not much scientific evidence out there but I thought asking you all would maybe get a conversation going on positives or negatives. 

Something I found interesting and to quote the end of the study ""There is a need for additional cost-effective and safe treatments. Growing evidence indicates that psilocybin mushrooms modulate the immune-inflammatory process in a beneficial manner and do so after only a single dose. Given its anti-inflammatory effects, along with the reassuring safety profile and low toxicity the therapeutic potential of psilocybin mushrooms in inflammatory diseases warrants further study."""

I was put on a 30mg taper of Prednisone from Oct - Dec when I was in a flare.

I had tears running down my face as she was helping me because I should be helping her but I was too embarrassed to ask my older siblings or parents. I am not a big fan of being vulnerable to people.

Some sources say to start right away, others suggest waiting for a second flare. My doctor falls into this category. An article by the National Institute of Health website says this:

some patients never experience another attack, particularly those with just mild serum urate elevations. Therefore, some clinicians believe it is best to take a wait and see approach, as once started, patients tend to stay on ULT for life. Beginning ULT after a second gout attack is easier to defend and we believe that all patients who have had three gout attacks should be started on ULT.

Disclaimer: I don't have a dysthymia diagnosis, but I don't think it exists as a real diagnosis in my country. I was diagnosed with ""mild to moderate depression"" and high functioning generalized anxiety disorder a year ago. I had cognitive behavioral therapy and started taking 50 mg of Zoloft, the lowest therapeutic dose. I've been sort of functioning with my depression and anxiety for years and it fits well with the dysthymia description I've usually seen.

I'm at the end of my PhD degree and I'm writing my thesis right now. I've been struggling a lot, but got through on stubbornness and with the support of amazing colleagues. I was so excited about closing this chapter of my life, so I've been pretty ok during the writing period. I had a couple of setbacks, my (very old) grandma passed away and I had to travel to my home country for the funeral. I got offered a really great apartment, I had my previous contract until the middle of January - a month after my hand-in deadline - but this new apartment was free from 1st of December. I just had to take it, it's a rare opportunity and the market in my city is so crazy I was prepared to be homeless for a month or two. So that one is mostly my fault, but the move took a lot of my time and energy.

When I found out I wouldn't make my deadline, I lost all the motivation. Nothing serious happens, no-one really cares about the deadline, but I really wanted to be done before Christmas. Realizing I couldn't do that, I just kinda finished my energy. It doesn't help that we only get a few hours of daylight and my sleep cycle is so off that I sleep through most of it.

I pretty much just hibernated for the last 3 days. I slept a lot, watched some TV, opened my thesis document and then gave up.

I knew it would pass. I never fall very deep into depression anymore, I just lose motivation to do anything for a few days and then get back on track. But this means I lost 3 days of writing and I'm going from ""not being finished before Christmas"" to ""not being finished before New Years""

I just wanted to rant a bit. Because I always think I'm better, I always think I have a handle on things. And then depression just sneaks up on me and takes over my life for a few days. Yes, I've gotten better at getting out of it with medication and CBT. And I will probably not get as many of those after my PhD. But this still sucks and I'm angry at myself for letting myself get there, even though I know I don't have full power over my brain.

Ranting to people that understand helps a lot. So thank you and have a nice weekend!

May you all have lovely stress-free holidays and enjoy whatever you're doing despite your brain being an asshole sometimes! :)"

I had a decent life before I got M.E. I didn't have depression my M.E is real so it's sickening that I was told by people on here that I have depression, that is not okay and I will not accept that. My M.E started when I wasn't depressed in fact I was HAPPY. But out of nowhere I got an infection where I had all these symptoms, went to the doctor and they told me they didn't know what it was sent me home told me to just rest. I did but never recovered since. I have been bedbound 90% of the time, I have diagnosed M.E so please stop saying I have depression when you have no idea how bad my M.E is. I would never ever insult another M.E sufferer like that **especially messaging me when I don't even know you** just to tell me ""if you think you can recover you have depression not M.E. No one recovers"" Recovery IS possible. Stop claiming that all those who recovered never had M.E. Sure SOME didn't.

I just wanted to say I've had M.E severe M.E for over 10 years. I spent a long time writing a few paragraphs out to help someone recently mentioning someone who had M.E and recovered and I was thumbed down because people don't believe you can recover from M.E. What a sad life it would be to believe you'll never recover. If you believe you'll be sick forever, you will be sick forever. The mind is a powerful thing and can work both good and bad. I have read every single book on M.E and over 100 books on inflammation and the brain. I am telling you YOU CAN recover. So again if you're going to dismiss me as delusional and insult me in my messages saying I'm crazy for believing you can recover and saying if I recover I had depression, that's your delusion not mine.

I had a decent life before I got M.E. I didn't have depression my M.E is real so it's sickening that I was told by people on here that I have depression, that is not okay and I will not accept that. My M.E started when I wasn't depressed in fact I was HAPPY. But out of nowhere I got an infection where I had all these symptoms, went to the doctor and they told me they didn't know what it was sent me home told me to just rest. I did but never recovered since. I have been bedbound 90% of the time, I have diagnosed M.E so please stop saying I have depression when you have no idea how bad my M.E is. I would never ever insult another M.E sufferer like that **especially messaging me when I don't even know you** just to tell me ""if you think you can recover you have depression not M.E. No one recovers"" Recovery IS possible. Stop claiming that all those who recovered never had M.E. Sure SOME didn't. Some probably did have depression or anxiety or something else other than M.E but some also DID have M.E and I have M.E not depression. I wish I had depression instead of this.

I think I eat like less than half the amount of food I should be eating every day. For some background info, Ive been underweight all of my life and have always had a tiny appetite to match, but these past few weeks Ive barely been eating. Ill have cereal or readymade pancakes for breakfast (and then end up hungry two hours later), and drink a nutrition shake at some point in the middle of the day. I go out for dinner with my sister two or three times a week (we live on campus and she was required to purchase a meal plan so she has to go out for food all the time), which is probably the only time I eat a decent sized meal. The rest of the week, I only eat like a few bites of food for lunch/dinner and spend a good portion of the day starving.
See, I have plenty of food in the fridge/freezer (my family lives less than two hours away so they give me food every other week), its just that I dont have the energy to portion the food and heat it up (even in paper plates). And if I do manage to heat something up (usually Ill just throw the entire container in the microwave if its rice) I can only eat a few bites before not being able to eat anymore. I know this sounds stupid, but its getting to the point where I feel dizzy almost every day. 
I used to think my depression wasnt bad enough because I still go to class and get relatively good grades but I honestly feel like at this rate Im gonna end up collapsing some day because Im too drained to eat properly.

Im 25M. I have to admit that allopurinol does great work for me. 7-8 months in and I dont have any more flare up since.

However, I notice thinning hair and also more hair loss. I was told by pharmacist when I went to refill my allopurinol that it could potentially cause hair loss and darkening skin.

 so I would like to ask all of you who take allopurinol. Do you guys experience any hair loss that might related to allo?

I'm not on allo (...yet...might be very soon) and I bought a UA test kit just to see what I could learn about my levels.

Does this story sound familiar?  

I woke up one day thinking I twisted my ankle while sleeping.  It was the ankle I broke when I was a kid so I figured I re-injured it somehow while tossing and turning.  Walked gingerly and wore a brace for a week until it felt better.  A year later - the same thing.  Woke up and felt like I twisted my ankle while sleeping.  Same thing - walked gingerly and wore a brace.  Then it started happening more often.  

Finally my wife says - she thinks it might be gout.  I go see my General Practitioner - after a blood test - lo and behold UA levels of 8 mg/dL.  Gives me a prescription of 100mg of Allopurinol, Colchicine and 50mg of  Indomethacin.  Take the Colchicine and Indomethacin - pain goes away.  Think nothing of it.  Skip on the Allo because I don't want to be on life long medication.

4 years since my first gout attack - Now every year around Thanksgiving to New Years I get a gout attack because of all the rich food I ingest.  I keep around Indomethacin as colchicine no longer seems to work for me.  The rest of the time I don't really have a problem.

6 years since my first gout attack - I start getting gout attacks in random places.  Elbow, knee, wrist, top of foot, bottom of foot, Achilles.  Gout attacks start happening 2 -3 times a year.  Now I need prednisone to start dealing with the pain.  I have prednisone and indomethacin laying around the house just in case.  I try to ""eat right"" - I lose a little weight.  I no longer drink.  I find that gluten is a major trigger for me and go gluten free.  

9 years since my first gout attack - I've missed going to events because I can barely walk.  I have a cane in every room to help me hobble around.  Not only is my diet changed but I've tried every supplement out there.  Tart cherry juice, tart cherry extract, apple cider vinegar, random gout pills from amazon.  I finally have enough and ask to see a specialist.  

10 years from my first gout attack and my first Rheumatologist  visit.  My Blood serum UA levels are at 10mg/dL.  I get sent for X-rays to see if there is any joint damage.  Start at 300 mg of allopurinol. and 25mg daily indomethacin.  Go back in a month to get blood tests.  1 month later my serum levels are at 8mg/dL.  Get another 300mg of allopurinol for a total of 600mg.  1 month later my serum levels are at 5.5mg/dL.  Add 100mg for a total of 700mg of allopurinol.  1 month later my serum levels are at 5mg/dL.  Negotiate with the doc to go back to 600mg - so that I only have to have 1 prescription filled - otherwise I needed the 300mg dose and the 100mg dose both filled.

6 months after holding at 5.5mg/dL and daily low level indomethacin - I have 4 pieces of pepperoni pizza.  Next day a bad gout attack.  Take high level dose 50mg of indomethacin 3x daily until the flare goes away.  Maybe 3 days of pain.  This is my last gout attack!

5 years after being on allopurinol - taken daily religiously with my vitamins - no pain, no mobility issues.  COVID vaccine taken - no gout flares.  Why? no my crystals. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There seem to be several replies of late that tend to imply that some of us on this forum think UA lowering medication is the only answer.  Although it may not be the only answer - it is one that is medically proven to actually affect the real trigger of gout - monosodium urate crystals.  If you are on here often you will see me post a link to this article - ""Why does a gout attack stop""

[https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/1/Suppl\_1/e000046](https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/1/Suppl_1/e000046)

And I post this often because I was under the illusion that somehow MSU crystals came and went with an attack.  IE I get an attack because I formed crystals.  Then the attack went away so the crystals went away.  Understanding that stopping the flare does not mean the crystals went away is the key point I try to make to everyone.  Anecdotally - if you look at my story - really what was happening to me is my UA levels kept going up and crystals started forming all over my joints. (Hence the attacks at various parts of my body). The crystals were still there - even with my serum UA levels below 6mg/dL for 6 months.  That is why I flared when I ate my trigger food.  Crystals still didn't finish dissolving even after 6 months of ""normal UA levels"".  

What does that mean for diet?  I would change the word to lifestyle change.  You basically have to keep eating for the rest of your life - food that would keep your UA levels below 6 mg/dL so that crystals can dissolve and so that you won't form new crystals.  Also you might still flare while those crystals dissolve.  Any other diet is just dealing with the inflammation not with the MSU crystals.  You'd need to monitor your UA levels so that you know you are keeping it low.  And obviously it isn't super easy to dissolve crystals - 6 months for me - and I've read about some people in the year(s) range and still having flares.  

So please understand where I am coming from.  I am one of you.  I suffered with this for a long time thinking I could manage it.  I didn't want to take life long medication.  Maybe you can manage it - and please come back here and tell us what you are doing if you find it helpful.  I am not against alternative treatment.  What I am trying to do is spread a better understanding of the disease and hopefully some of you won't have to suffer for 10 years before seeking help."

So to follow up, Ive been on Prednisone now since Friday and its helped a ton with the pain and my ankle has nearly returned completely to normal, however I am now getting a bit of a flare up in my left toe (the other foot). So my questions are: is this normal? And is there something Im doing wrong? 

Also, I talked to my family doctor on Monday and she believed that this could be a one time thing but now with this second flare up Im not too sure. I asked about a rheumatologist (everyones said I should talk to one) but she said theres nothing more they could tell me that I havent heard already. Another questionable thing she told me was that if the medication Im on for blood pressure, between the diuretic and diltiazem, she thinks the latter is more likely to have caused the gout. But diltiazem only has like a 1-2% chance of causing gout whereas a diuretic is a leading cause in a lot of cases Ive read. So Im also seeking advice on whether or not I should just call her back and get her to send me to a specialist or wait and see how this toe flare up goes."

About a year ago I was in bed all the time; I thought that part of the Borderline personality disorder and the depression that I had been having for many years, that happened for 5 years, until many things started to improve, even so I didn't have any energy to get out of bed little by little and I didn't know what was wrong with me, I was very very alone, they have been very painful years and I don't think that any human being should go through what I have gone through; I just had some of those friendships that almost never last (or maybe the problem is me), the ones you meet online, until I fell in love with a friend, and we tried to have a long-distance relationship; I think I have never fallen so deeply in love with someone in person; while I was his girlfriend, I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and I understood everything that was wrong with me, it has been a long and complicated road but I am already improving from this too, I even applied to enter the University and next month he entered classes . The problem is that the relationship with the boy deteriorated little by little; we fought too much in the last few months, he made me feel miserable and insulted me, I couldn't bear so much pain anymore and I ended up with him; We have about a week since we broke up and I've realized that I'm more alone than I can bear, I mean, he's gone, I don't have a very good relationship with my family, I haven't had friends for years; before I was alone the same, but I didn't notice how painful it was, I think that's why I clung to him so much even though he was such a different person from the one I had known, I guess I needed to vent, thanks for reading."

t5_2r4lw,s1vjpf,I'm not honestly sure I have CFS,"[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","Where I am
19M. Hey all, so first off I'll say I'm having bad brain fog right now so if my post isn't well articulated that's why. I will also say I'm not honestly sure I have CFS, but I'm awaiting a bunch of tests and assuming those come back negative then CFS is what I'll have left anyways. Does seem like the most accurate diagnosis so far, though.

I just need to put some text down somewhere where I can at least imagine it's being read by people who understand, I hope that's okay. I'm not really expecting anyone to read this.

I'll also try to put it into a bunch of paragraphs because I don't know about you but I have issues reading big blocks of text.

Eight years ago I had issues with severe fatigue and depression, and mild joint pain. I was immediately referred to a psychiatrist, which we didn't follow up on because my fatigue faded and only left mild daytime sleepiness.

I was instead just told to take ibuprofen for joint pain . Bruh an 11 year old has joint pain and you're like ""hmm have you tried painkillers?"" LOL

Fast forward four years and my joint pain converges to the point where I can walk but no longer run or jump for any significant period of time. Tested for celiacs and rheumatoid arthritis and anemia and they all come back saying I'm the picture of health. Get told to take ibuprofen again.

Around that period I'm getting more and more fatigue and daytime sleepiness. I chalk it up to being on a highschool schedule. Besides, it's nothing I couldn't ignore anyways.

Hands and feet also now dark red all the time. Itchy in the shower. Again, nothing I can't ignore. This continues to this day. I do not fit the diagnostic criteria for POTS, but I suspect this is still a form of dysautonomia.

Two years after that and I'm extremely depressed and fatigued. As in I can't get out of bed. Finally go to psychiatrist, get prescribed antidepressants because of course I do, and that's that. Try Prozac first, then Zoloft, and then I'm told I may be type 2 bipolar (long story), and I go on Lamictal. Also on Buspar for anxiety.

Lamictal is fine, maybe it helps maybe it doesn't. Very few side effects which is why I stick with it.

So now to today, where I am by far at my worst. Depression is basically gone, but I am worse in all other respects. I am not bedbound but I am housebound. I am fortunate enough to have extremely supportive parents who help me.

Can't drive, had to quit my programming job because it is too mentally taxing. Can't play chess anymore for the same reason. Can't be with friends because it is so draining it isn't enjoyable. No longer going to go to college. Quit exercise entirely.

I've had air hunger for a while, which is weird. I'll just be sitting on the couch and yet need air as if I'd just run 5k. Fatigue so bad I can't move. Extreme anger/bitterness at nothing that comes and goes very suddenly. All of these things wax and wane, as if dancing to a song I can't hear.

More and more blood work continues to say I'm A-OK 

I'm too young for this. I'm 19 but feel 90. I walk around like a FNAF animatronic. All of my energy goes into unproductive doctors visits. I have lost that feeling of invincibility I took for granted those eight years ago.

And to top it all off, I am now potentially faced with the prospect of having one of the only illnesses which, not only has no cure, but also has no treatment paths either. I hope that is not insulting to those with CFS, just that there is an agreement that CFS sucks.

The silver lining is that I'm young and therefore have a higher chance of at least partial recovery if I do have it. Even better, there is the very real possibility of a cure in the future, possibly soon, which would benefit not just me but everyone.

Sorry for the rant, I checked the rules and it didn't seem like this was against them. Just needed to put it somewhere. I am aware I don't have it 1/10 as bad as many of the people on this sub, and I am not looking for sympathy."

Hey guys, so my TSH shot up quite a bit after my first two vaccine doses (Moderna) and I needed a medication dose increase after nearly 7 years on the same dose. Started feeling great after the dose increase. 

I had my booster in early December and I now have the type of chronic fatigue I had before the increase - like I could sleep the entire day I was allowed, and it still wouldnt be enough. Im wondering if my TSH went up again after my booster. Again Moderna.

My dad had his thyroid surgically removed in 2016. He too had been on the same medication dose since then. Over Christmas break, he also went through some extreme fatigue to the point of also sleeping the entire day for a few days and not being able to wake up. Just not enough strength. Well I took him to the hospital then and figured he may have an infection, which he is prone to at his age and due to other health issues. But no infection found this time, but oddly his TSH had shot up. Like quite a bit. I was shocked and so were his doctors that given his health profile that this was the only thing out of order they could find. He had also just recently had his booster shot. This time Moderna like me, though he had Pfizer for the first two shots.

He doesnt have a thyroid at all though, so its not like his thyroid function decreased, thereby causing the TSH increase. So I guess his body was just using up the hormone faster? 

Im just curious of any anecdotal correlations anyone else has experienced abs whether this is something worth raising to the FDA as a potential previously undocumented side effect, like the menstrual cycle impacts."

Hello all! 

Looking for some advice/suggestions on how to start making life style changes. 

For context: I'm one year out from my official N2 diagnosis but I have been symptomatic for about 14 years (that persistent chronic fatigue syndrome diagnosis followed me for a long time). I also struggle with depression and anxiety. 

Since my diagnosis, I've had a lot of struggles finding appropriate medications/dosing. I swear, I've had the absolute worst reaction to all the normal meds. It has really taken a toll on my health as I've spent so much time literally in bed, unable to move due to fatigue/nausea/headaches/etc. I've finally settled on an okay regimen of Vyvanse and Lunesta, but I'm still really tired and just exhausted all the time.

That said, I still feel pretty bad. I absolutely know that exercise and a gluten-free/low-carb diet will help because before the diagnosis they were how I was able to ""manage"" my symptoms. But I just seem unable to get myself to get back to exercising and eating healthy. I know that there are strong ties to mental health, but any suggestions for starting to get these habits back when I'm just so tired all the time?

TL;DR - advice on beginning exercise and healthy eating habits when narcolepsy makes you so tired all the time?"

Excitotoxicity is a pathological process caused by overstimulation of neuronal cells by excitatory neurotransmitters (e.g. Glutamate).

Excitotoxicity is a phenomenon that describes the toxic actions of excitatory neurotransmitters, primarily glutamate, where the exacerbated or prolonged activation of glutamate receptors starts a cascade of neurotoxicity that ultimately leads to the loss of neuronal function and cell death.

Im reading about this thing and it sounds awefully familiar. Ive made several posts here about my situation. For me CFS/ME led to a deminshed treshold towards sensorary stimulation. Im practically free of CFS/ME, I no longer get PEM, but my brain became stuck in this sensitivity mode and it has deterorated to the point where I cant even use my brain to think without getting warning-signal type symptoms

Im right now using a neuropeptide called cerebrolysin to see if I can fix this. Besides being an agent of neurogenesis and a healing peptides for basically every CNS disease, one of its main modes of action is a reduction in excitotoxicity

For the past 15 years or so, off and on, Ive had issues with wakefulness, and have a tendency to fall asleep, or start falling asleep, at the drop of a hat in uncomfortable positions when Im not otherwise occupied, like during car rides or during slogs at my desk job. Ive had sleep paralysis when I fall asleep during the day while sitting in chairs  in fact this seems to be the only time I have it. Whenever I complained about sleep problems to my therapist or parents or old GPs I was told I was just doing it wrong and looking at sleep apps it does seem evident that Im only getting \~6 hours a night of actual sleep. When I tried getting to bed earlier, I would just wake up earlier. Naps, or even just laying down for a minute, seems to refresh me for a while but this doesnt seem to actually have any effect on if Ill get tired again. 

I dont think Ive had cataplexy? The only thing I can think of is like Im on the couch or in bed after work playing a phone game and I doze off for a split second and Ive dropped my phone, but I think thats actual sleep.

I finally told my GPs office and they seem to think this is pretty urgent despite that Ive lived this way for fifteen years. The RN I talked to suggested mild narcolepsy. They gave me a number for a sleep doc and when I told them how long it would take they suggested they could get me a sleep test sooner.

Based on what little I know Im concerned that theyll make me take a home sleep test which wouldnt test for narcolepsy at all, but would still cost me money and make the wait for an in-office one even longer. Im fat and I snore but my experiences dont really point to OSA, I dont think?

Hi, this'll be a long one so apologies

I haven't been properly diagnosed, but from what I read online, dysthymia seems to describe how I feel though not all the symptoms apply to me. I feel like a diagnosis (or some sort of assessment from a professional) would help me alleviate some anxiety about what I feel; to be able to say that I am how I am because of a condition is better than because I'm a sub-par/ faulty human being. 

Cos honestly it feels like that sometimes--like I'm just no good at being a person, and that's why I have so little friends, why I don't have great relations with my family, why my romantic relationship failed, why I feel so aimless and unmotivated. But then this downward spiral is temporay, it's a pendulum that comes and goes. 

I've been to counselling, I've done CBT on my own, I've had conversations with my friends about this which did help, but motherfucker it keeps coming back!!! It's like that stupid 90s song about getting knocked down and getting up again, expect less funny and way more annoying. So maybe life is supposed to be hard and everyone feels what I feel to some degree; but then why does it feel like I'm losing my mind sometimes and other times I'm ok? I hate being a contradiction, hate feeling pulled apart by horses, hate swinging between feeling down and not-so-down. 

And yet, I also feel like all this defines me--my head-banging introspection and sensitivity is what makes me special and unique. Part of me feels precious about these qualities in me so should I try to be ok with it instead of wanting to change? Just how does one live??? How should a person be????

Anyway, for those still sticking around or **TL;DR**

* How did you get diagnosed and how did that make you feel? 
* How do you cope/ keep yourself together

Warning: this is a rant and request for advice about my partner with undiagnosed CFS. 



My partner and I have been together for 2 years. Last year, they started getting symptoms like migraines and post-exertion fatigue, for which theyve seen several doctors about. The doctors have prescribed hardcore medications and suggested elimination diets, and at first, my partner followed these things to the letter and they worked. At first, we thought it was long COVID, but now think its CFS. They have stopped doing their elimination diet and taking their migraine medication on time and unsurprisingly, they have gotten worse. Im sitting in an ER with them for the 4th(?) time in the last 6 months. Once was for eating an XL bag of skittles (processed sugar exacerbates their migraines and gastro issues) and this time is for waiting 4 days before taking their migraine meds. This has caused them to miss work and put stress on our finances, and now theyre wanting me to spend less on food by cooking meals at home, but I also work full time and have to cook since they dont have the energy or stamina to do so. I want to be supportive and helpful, but when I try to bring up their shortcomings on maintaining their health, they are very defensive: I cant live restricted like this forever. 

I want to understand what I can do to help. I dont want to be their parent. I want to be a supportive partner, meaning they put in effort and so do I. Am I missing something? For people living with CFS, what else can I do to support them?"

Hi everyone,

I've been lurking on this sub for a while. I have never been diagnosed with gout however after being on this sub for a while and looking up other symptoms I believe I have gout.

However when I went to the doctors 2 days ago they said they're treating me for Plantar Fasciittis as I'm too young for gout (25M)

Did anyone else struggle with this as a diagnosis before gout? 

Now Im not one to act as if I know more or better than a doctor but I had to question whether that was the right diagnosis. 

My symptoms:
1. Pain and when I say pain I mean a lot of it. It's brought tears to my eyes. It's my big toe that is causing the most pain. 
2. Cold and shivery and then hot the next
3. Blue foot with swelling. 
4. Stiff toe and unable to move it
5. Confusion

I had codiene and also Naproxen prescribed to me however these have done nothing in regards to ease or relieve my pain. 

I understand I can't take Reddit as medical advice however I'm just looking for someone with common ground who might be able to offer some form of relief.

*Edit*

Just want to say thank you to everyone who's commented. I've just spent the past 3 hours in the medical department and I've been somewhat diagnosed with Gout. Got a 5 day bout of Colchicine to see if that helps. 

Once again thank you all for the help and feedback. I feel welcome into the gout community already!"

I'm not saying that there is absolutely no way my binge eating may have some deeper meaning, but as far as i know, i don't really binge-eat due to emotion or any kind of trauma in my life. Anyone else deal with this?"

Hi, this'll be a long one so apologies

I haven't been properly diagnosed, but from what I read online, dysthymia seems to describe how I feel though not all the symptoms apply to me. I feel like a diagnosis (or some sort of assessment from a professional) would help me alleviate some anxiety about what I feel; to be able to say that I am how I am because of a condition is better than because I'm a sub-par/ faulty human being. 

Cos honestly it feels like that sometimes--like I'm just no good at being a person, and that's why I have so little friends, why I don't have great relations with my family, why my romantic relationship failed, why I feel so aimless and unmotivated. But then this downward spiral is temporay, it's a pendulum that comes and goes. 

I've been to counselling, I've done CBT on my own, I've had conversations with my friends about this which did help, but motherfucker it keeps coming back!!! It's like that stupid 90s song about getting knocked down and getting up again, expect less funny and way more annoying. So maybe life is supposed to be hard and everyone feels what I feel to some degree; but then why does it feel like I'm losing my mind sometimes and other times I'm ok? I hate being a contradiction, hate feeling pulled apart by horses, hate swinging between feeling down and not-so-down. 

And yet, I also feel like all this defines me--my head-banging introspection and sensitivity is what makes me special and unique. Part of me feels precious about these qualities in me so should I try to be ok with it instead of wanting to change? Just how does one live??? How should a person be????

I've been TTC for almost a year and my TSH level came back at 3.06. Although this isn't high for the average person, it seems that it is too high for trying to conceive and pregnancy, especially because thyroid levels typically raise significantly once pregnant. 

I'm going to talk to my doctor about starting medication, but in researching Levothyroxine I came across a study from 04/01/2021 that concluded there is a significantly increased risk of at least five different types of cancer for levothyroxine users.  

I tried searching about this in this sub but couldn't find a thread yet. Has anyone talked to their doctor about this? Although I'm not hypo levels, I have all of the symptoms of hypo and if I took the medicine and felt better then I would like to stay on it after pregnancy, but this study has me worried.

Kind of a bittersweet moment. Saves me having to go out of my way over and over again to go for a million tests that I already know won't turn up anything, but at the same time sort of makes the diagnosis of exclusion feel a bit less legitimate.

Hello

I just got my lab tests and this is how my thyroid tests came out:

- TSH 6,38 (normal range 0,27 - 4,2)
- T4L 15,50 (normal range 12 - 22)

I have always had a high TSH. Sometimes lower though (2,5).
T4L has always been in the normal range. 

No antibodies so far.

I don't really feel any classic symptoms : 

- I'm quite unaffected by cold
- I don't feel particularly tired
- I don't sleep a lot at night and I don't nap
- Face skin is normal (a bit oily on the T zone but nothing crazy)
- Eyebrows look normal
- Body skin is dry but it's always been like that
- Hair is thin though but nothing too alarming and it has always been on the thin side. I do lose more hair than I'd like to.
- Weight hasn't changed much. It has recently but my diet has been hectic. I do have a hard time losing weight, my metabolism is sluggish
- My face is puffy in the morning but it could be too much sodium

The fact that I don't feel cold or that I don't feel tired could mean that my hypothyroidism isn't that bad?

What could trigger a high TSH if T4L is normal? Is it something that can be triggered by external factors such as stress?
I get really scared of blood draws and I thought that maybe all this stress (it's very intense and I start getting super anxious the evening before) could trigger an inflammatory response that temporarily affects the thyroid?

Or could it be due to a brief mild infection?

Or is it the clear sign that it will worsen with time?


Meanwhile what can I do about it habit-wise? My GP won't prescribe anything to me.

Are there any foods, plants, oils that have helped you?

Thank you for your help!"

Hi all
Only realized I had mild gout about 18 months ago. Google helped as did confirmation with doctor . Since then I'm acutely when I am about to get it (that tingling feeling plus growing lump .. What is that called?) on my left big toe.
I've had it come and go maybe 3 to 4 times since first time (not enough water meat dairy very little vege fruit diet did it..). Have tried change diet but it's slow and been using tart cherry (juice seems to work better than capsules), ibrufen, plenty fruit and vege (leaving out spinach... Never liked it anyway ). Drinking lot more water. Personally found soft drinks main trigger for me.
How long do people find it takes for the gout lump to reduce in size?. Is there a faster way for uric crystals to reduce ? (I realize might never go completely). Previous times I've had attacks I get soreness to go within a week or two (only once it got bad for doctor to make me take a week off and use 50mg indo .. Can't spell name).
Have people changed their diets completely?
Do you retain rice/pasta in it?
I realize part of it is portion size and ""eat in moderation"" (what a cliche) but are there things you cut out after getting gout ???
Btw Apple cider vinegar lemon honey mix has worked well for me"

Im a 24 year old female and Ive been losing my hair since I was 20 years old. 
Ive always felt something was off because my whole life, I had always been super fatigued. Looking back, other signs could have been brittle nails and constant constipation. I had two basically inconclusive sleep studies by the age of 13. One said sleep apnea and the other Narcolepsy. 

I even saw a neurologist twice with no explanation of what was going on. Everything came back normal. 

My hair had previously been super thick. Now, my hair all over my body is super thin. For years, my my labs of things like Vitamin D and iron have always come back slightly deficient. I took those with no improvement in energy. Doctors were no help, and I kept changing. One even told me I was losing hair because of my depression. Finally, two weeks ago, I just went and paid out of pocket for a Thyroid panel locally. I got tired of researching and feeling crazy because of doctors. I never got a referral for a dermatologist either.

My TSH was 0.447 and my T3 uptake was 20. 

I changed providers again and with these results, I got a retest and currently waiting for those results. 

Im happy, but its bittersweet. I have two kids who are having extreme diffuse hair loss. Their Thyroid levels came back normal, but I know that alone doesnt mean that. Their vitamin levels also look normal too.

I recently found out my mom had borderline levels years, but the doctor never looked into it. Her hair loss is really bad. My sisters, who are all older than me, are also now thinning all over their head and extreme fatigue. They are untested, but I have advised them to get tested.

Pretty much posted for support. I definitely feel alone and tired of feeling like I am fighting to be heard.

I've been doing a lot of research with respect to liothyronine sodium's half-life. There's a lot of debate and confusion with regards to this topic, as the FDA, and another reputable scientific sources, state that T3 half-life is 2.5 days.

>The onset of activity of liothyronine sodium is rapid, occurring within a few hours. Maximum pharmacologic response occurs within 2 or 3 days, providing early clinical response. The biological half-life is **about 2-1/2 days**. T3 is almost totally absorbed, 95 percent in 4 hours. **May 17, 2002**

[Source here.](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2002/10379s47lbl.pdf)

But that statement is from May, 2002. Since then a lot of people have shared their personal experiences on the Internet along with blood works to corroborate that, in their personal experience, T3 half-life is shorter than 2.5 days.

Then we add up more recent studies, highlighting the thorough trial by Jonklaas et al, 2015.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5167556/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5167556/)

Patients took 50mcg of T3. They took blood samples every 30 minutes for the first 4 hours, then every 1 hour up to 12 hours after administration, then at 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 96 hours.

You can see as the Cmax is reached 2.5 hours after administration (346 ng/dl). Now, the half-life of a drug is the time that it takes to reach the 50% of the Cmax in this case the 50% should be around 173 ng/dl. As you can see in Table 2, at the 12 hour mark the concentration is of 157 ng/dl. The half life is around 10 hours because it's the time to reach the 50% of the Cmax (2.5h - 12h = 10h).

That's why the new perspective for hypothyroid patients treated with T3 preparations is to split the dose into three doses distributed across the day.

**TLDR: FDA's statement of T3 half-life of 2.5 days is outdated. New evidence shows that the half-life is of 10h, as it was the time taken to observe a 50% decrease in blood levels from the Cmax.**"

Hey Guys, Im new to this thread. After reading for awhile I can tell that there are a ton of people that are in much worse situations than me, and I hope everyones situation gets better. I feel almost like I dont belong when sharing my minute mental health problems in comparison to others, but I thought Id post this anyways. I am 20 years old and I feel I am very ambitious for my age. I have big goals and most days i strive to reach those goals. I work as a realtor and have been doing great for myself lately. The reason I am posting is because for awhile now I have felt a sort of depressed from time to time throughout my days of working hard and motivating myself to be the best I can be. It doesnt always get in the way of work, sometimes it just nags at the back of my mind while I work, but sometimes it prevents me from working that day all together. The best way I can describe it is It feels almost as if Im on a cliff and my back is turned to the edge and I can see my goals ahead of me and I am willing to do what it will take to reach those goals, however there is a dark abyss behind me at all times that follows me. Some days I sort of bungee jump into that dark abyss for a moment sometimes for hours, sometimes a whole day, but never more than a few days and then I gain my motivation again. I live with my girlfriend whom Ive been with for over 3 years and its a great relationship and Ive noticed I specifically feel the worst and sort of bungee jump into that abyss when Im alone and shes at work and I have nothing to do. During these times if I work then it makes me feel a better but eventually I get tired and need time to relax and do my own things, but whenever I give myself that time is when I feel the worst mentally. I have no interest in hobbies like video games or reading or anything thats not work related and so I either work and never relax which burns me out or sit on my phone switching from TikTok to Instagram for hours until she gets home. I was coping with this for awhile by smoking weed whenever she was at work, and it made me feel so much better everyday, but it unmotivated me from my career and made me not really want to work in the morning (but I was okay with it because Id get high). I ultimately decided to stop smoking and Its been about 30 days since Ive smoked weed and this feeling has been getting worse and worse.

Hi all. I have weird symptoms and doctors are clueless. I think it could be CFS but I dont seem to meet all the criteria. What do you think? (Please if you are to comment read the whole story; important info at the end. Thx.)

\- Started as a burnout from stress in May 2021. No energy, sleeping 14h/day.

 \- Many weeks later: sensitivity to light, bright colors, sound, seeing movement, could not tolerate screens, could not talk for more than 15 minutes, could not read. All those made my brain hurt. Memory issues. 

\- Got my energy back within 2 months but one day I woke up and it was gone. 

\- It never recovered since then and got gradually worse. 

\- Main symptoms in the last 2 months: Weird sensation in my thighs so I cant stand for more than a few minutes at a time because the sensation worsens. If I push past the limit I crash, MEANING muscles become loose/relax, tingling, feel my heart beating in the muscles. Energy drops and general discomfort. Muscles shuddering. Lasts for hours or 1-2 days.  
 \- The sensation is more intense in the part of the body that I exerted (back, arms or legs) but spreads. The last place it leaves is the place that I exerted. But it rarely leaves 100%.  
 \- Brain exertion and social exertion dont make body crash.  
 \- Is this PEM?

\- 75% of the time when I am sitting I do have a correct/high energy level but I cant do anything because of what I just described. 

\- I sleep well and feel fresh in the morning and need no naps

\- My brain is recovering, faster each month. It does not crash.  
 \- Brain and body state at a given time are NOT influenced by each other  
 \- I do not have brain fog

\- No other symptoms 

  
So basically: I am NOT autonomous and may have PEM; but no other symptoms. Thoughts? Thanks."

Hey! Hope you guys are doing well.

Like many of you, I am diagnosed with having gout. I first started having my first flare up around 2015. I was only 16 at the time. I was diagnosed through a blood test that showed high uric acid levels. Since then, I have had gout flare up pretty much once every year, treating it with ibuprofen only.

As a way to reduce my uric acid levels, I reduced meat/seafood consumption, having vegetarian days and lost weight (though not super drastically) to a healthier bmi. However, it seems to not be working as it still happens every year. Same spot every time.

Around 3 years ago, I had bursitis as well on my elbow, which had happened again a couple months ago. Inflamation in bursa sacs can be attributed to gout though the inflamation did not get tested for uric acid.

Now at 21 year of age, I think my gout is developing to chronic gout. My last attack was 2 months ago, with an episode of bursitis right before that, and now, as with many people, am now awaken at 4am in the morning to pain on my big toe. This is the second time in the year with one 2 months before, which I think now classifies as chronic gout.

At the start, the doctor was hesistant on putting me on uric acid lowering medication like allupurinol because I was so young. Now, at 21, with more frequent attacks, one happening pretty much back to back after the previous one, I am starting to think medication is the only way to prevent this. But I am still what most people and doctors would agree to be very young to have chronic gout.

My question to you guys: should I request my doctor to put me on uric acid lowering medication?

Tldr: First gout at 16. Now I'm 21 and having 2nd gout attack of year for first time. Time to go on uric acid lowering medication or still too young?"

This post may not belong here, but I figured there's really no better place to ask for opinions, so here I am.

When I was a child, I had mild cataplexy fairly regularly. Whenever I had extreme emotions, laughter, anger, or fear, my hands would lose all strength. I could not hold a pen in my hand, let alone write with one. 

I remember I had a really nasty teacher when I was 8, and she was once screaming at me asking me to write something down, and she kept getting angrier because I couldn't obey, which was making things even worse for me.

I also experienced hallucinations when trying to fall asleep, and sleep paralysis when trying to wake up. Both of which happened several times, but not THAT often. I don't believe these are that uncommon but I figured I'd make a mention of it.

But here's the thing, I do not believe I've ever had Excessive Daytime Sleepiness, which means I would probably not be diagnosed with Narcolepsy (not then nor now).

The other good news is that pretty much all of these stopped happening during/after teenagehood.

Now my question: assuming that narcolepsy is like a spectrum, would it be possible that I have an extremely mild version of it, which may flare up again (or get worse) if I go through a stressful period? (my childhood was a stressful period of my life)"

***Important note***:I do believe in the power of healthy food, as they contain active compounds, which have been proven to have real health benefits. However, I want to make clear that this recipe is NOT a substitute for gout medication. Allopurinol is a powerful drug which can bring your uric acid serum levels down, and colchicine is a great alkaloid to stop or reduce the pain of a gout attack. This soup may help your gout but this recipe is especially just a very healthy soup with ingredients that may lower uric acid levels and may have anti-inflammatory effects. Effects are proven in vitro or in vivo and not always in humans. I just wanted to do this as a little experiment for fun.

Base ingredients:

* 600 grams of celery root
* 400 grams of celery
* 10 grams of turmeric
* 10 grams of curry powder
* 5 grams of black pepper
* One ginger root
* Two cloves of garlic

As a scientist and gout sufferer, I wanted to combine high anti-inflammatory and uric acid lowering foods in a soup. I started with the essential ingredients with scientific proven benefits and during the making I added extra super-healthy ingredients to the soup. I am a vegetarian since I suffer from gout, so no meat will be used in this recipe.

***Important note***:I do believe in the power of healthy food, as they contain active compounds, which have been proven to have real health benefits. However, I want to make clear that this recipe is NOT a substitute for gout medication. Allopurinol is a powerful drug which can bring your uric acid serum levels down, and colchicine is a great alkaloid to stop or reduce the pain of a gout attack. This soup may help your gout but this recipe is especially just a very healthy soup with ingredients that may lower uric acid levels and may have anti-inflammatory effects. Effects are proven in vitro or in vivo and not always in humans. I just wanted to do this as a little experiment for fun.

Base ingredients:

* 600 grams of celery root
* 400 grams of celery
* 10 grams of turmeric
* 10 grams of curry powder
* 5 grams of black pepper
* One ginger root
* Two cloves of garlic
* 2,5 liters of water
* 30 mL of sunflower oil for sautéing

\*\*Method (Part I)\*\*I heated the oil in a large pot, added garlic, ginger and spices to the mix and sautéd for a short period. I then added cubes of celery root, pieces of celery to the pot. After few minutes of sautéing, I added the 2,5 liters of water. I cooked to a broth for nearly 45 minutes.

**Taste test**Not really yummy as expected, so I started improvising and added a few ingredients:

* More pepper, curry powder, salt and 8 bay laurel leaves

* 450 grams of broccoli (frozen)

This helped a lot, but I told him after about two weeks that it was affecting my anxiety and he pulled me off it.
And thats when it all began.
He tried to explain to me that it was because I had seen what everyone elses normal was and then been shot back into mine, and I dont know if it was that, if it was because I had been on my anti anxiety meds long enough for them to work completely and there was nothing to keep me up, if it was both, or if it was just at this point that my body decided to develop this (I was 20 at the time so I still fell under the normal development window).

So I've been a gout sufferer for few years and I know my triggers: beer & regular soda with sugar. And it always attacks my ankle and knee. 

Few weeks ago it was a stressful day at work on Friday and I opened the fridge without thinking and grabbed a can of Coke Zero and drank it in one gulp but in reality it was regular Coke.

Sure enough, the next morning I was feeling the tingling sensation. We happen to have the family Zoom call and my MIL who lives in Korea hears that I am suffering from gout. She tells me that she will send us something that's good for gout and I don't think much of it. By Sunday morning, I was having a full blown gout attack and my right ankle is stiff as hell. 

A package arrives on following Wed from Korea and it was this weird looking machine that looks like a foot massager. As I am reading the manual, it sounds like a total snake oil. It talks about how cancer happens more often to those that have lower body temperature and raising 1 degree celsius in your core body temperature can reduce the risk of cancer by more than 50%. It also talks about how the high frequency current that's emitted from this machine creating thermal energy will make the cells in your body vibrate and help with all types of joint pains. By then I was fully convinced this was a fraud and I called me MIL and was like I ain't falling for this horseshit and told her I will be sending it  for her to get a refund. But she's adamant that I give it a try since someone else that she knows who was suffering from gout big time has been using the same machine and it has helped significantly.

So I decide to give it a try. Within a minute or two, you can feel the warmth and as times goes by, I am feeling this tiny shocks all over my feet and within 15 mins I am sweating like I ran a marathon. 

About an hour after I finish the session, I can feel the stiffness on my ankle subsiding just a little bit. I wanted to try it once again but the manual says only to do one 30 min session every 12 hours. So the next morning as soon as I woke up, I did it again and sure enough, I gained more flexibility around my ankle to the point where I was able to grab it and crack my ankle which usually is the sign that my gout is going away. This normally happens about a week after the full attack starts. But with this device, I was pain free within 48 hours and everything was back to normal. 

To test if this was not just a placebo effect, I drank 2 cans of beer few days later but it didn't cause an attack and I am afraid to try again for obvious reasons. I even sent out a message to people that I know in my area to see if anyone was suffering from gout and if so, come and try this machine to see if it actually works for them as well.  

By no means, I am trying to start a controversy or gain anything materially from this (I am not even posting anything particular about the product and googling won't help either) but anyone else has heard about high frequency thermal treatment for gout? My MIL called the manufacturer and they are claiming the high frequency thermal energy is causing the uric crystals to vibrate and they are being shaken off from the joint and going back into the bloodstream. I know high frequency treatment exists for acne but I've never heard such thing for gout. Any input will be greatly appreciated."

My step-brother (44) has recently been diagnosed with ADHD, so we've talked about it a lot. Many of his presentations chime with me, and I know there's a potential link between CFS and ADHD. Of course, I've since read a shitload of stuff online and even though I try to put it through the bullshit filter I felt like it resonates with me. I've always felt neuro atypical, but not enough for a condition. I did an in-depth online test, from some American research group, which said it's 'likely' that I have it. Obvious thing would be to speak to my GP about it, but aside from not wanting to add to the current pressure on the NHS, I don't feel my wife would take it very well.

We're living on her wage, plus a *small* amount of benefits. She does extra tutoring, and even without that her days are long and hard. We are only just keeping our heads above water. Naturally I feel like a huge burden, anyway. She's 100% sympathetic to my condition, but the actual situation puts a lot of stress on her. When my brother (who has always been 'idiosyncratic', to say the least) was diagnosed she half joked that I'd better not decide I have that as well. Not maliciously, but more 'i can barely cope as it is'

I used to work in social care, and something I'd always ask clients looking for a diagnosis was 'will knowing this help you, or not? What are your reasons for seeking a diagnosis?' 
When I get down to it, my reason is medical - would ADHD meds possibly help with my CFS? Might they help with my exhausting cyclic thinking? And I don't know if that's a good enough reason to either potentially load my wife up with yet more worry, or to go behind her back and investigate this without her knowledge? Which I'd struggle with, because we're always open with each other.

Sorry for the long, rambling post. I'm not looking for guidance or answers. It just feels good to get that all out of my head."

Sorry for the long post, Im still in shock and processing my condition.

Hey everyone!

Im in the middle of the diagnose process after I couldnt handle anymore and failed with trying to sleep as everyone else.
Already did PSG (no stage 1 at all, sleep latency 00:09 [min], REM latency 01:23 [min] - is it normal for N1?)

My sleep doctor saw the PSG and thought thats N1/IH, and sent me to MSLT (havent done yet), even I told her that I dont have muscle failures triggered by emotions, because I thought thats about full body collapsing like in the movies for everyone with cataplexy.

Just yesterday I saw a video (video 1, links below) of a doctor explaining what Cataplexy is for real with a lot of the patients, and understood that laughing so hard sometimes that Im falling to the next chair/floor and cant stand for a minute (exactly like in video 2) isnt normal at all and that I have N1.

In the last years Ive been treated for ADD with Concerta 72 mg while studying, with a lot of side effects, but recently moved for taking Amphetamin Mix (Adderall XR) 30 mg. 
Both can help me staying awake end avoiding the I have to sleep NOW feeling and micro sleeps (even though I can totally being tired and sleep with both if I wasnt sleeping enough at night).
But still, my day/night cycle is the worse and Im feeling really sleepy and unfocused, unless I managed somehow to sleep properly a few night in a raw (pretty rare) AND Ive took the Amphetamins.
Im 24 yo male.

So, as a Narcolepsy newbie - Id like to hear your opinion and experience:

*Regardless the price*, What do you think is the best and the most promising/advanced treatment available/on research for N1 sleeping difficulties, like having regular day/night cycle?

t5_2srfv,r4yf67,"But not doing things due to executive dysfunction isn't a capability issue, it's a capacity issue. ","[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","Capability vs Capacity
I thought I'd share something I actually managed to internalize recently, as it's helped my brain a little bit.

I often feel incapable of doing things I either know that I have the ability to do, or guilty for not doing all the things all the time because I KNOW I could do them. But instead I do less productive things or half-ass stuff that I could do.

I have the skills to do things. I know this because I function in society (mostly), or have done the things I need/want to do before.

But not doing things due to executive dysfunction isn't a capability issue, it's a capacity issue. 

You are capable, you just don't have the capacity right now. If your phone dies, it's still capable of doing all the things things it's built to do, it just needs to be changed first. Maybe the phone's battery doesn't last long - that just means that you should carry a portable charger or charge it more often. It just needs accommodation to do what it's capable of doing.

Maybe it runs out of batter faster when it's being used a lot or in the cold. Maybe it's fine and lasts a long time in better conditions.

Lack of capacity is a temporary state, even if it lasts a seemingly long time or occurs more frequently than we want.

Separating these two factors has helped me feel a bit less like shit and realize when I need a break. I've always had the knowledge if executive functioning impairment, fatigue from mental health, etc. But it never really 'clicked' until recently. My therapist seemed pretty jazzed that I came to this conclusion, so I thought I'd share.

You are a capable person. You have skills and abilities. You're just tired and your capacity to do them is being depleted by depression/other mental health stuff/crappy situational factors. You are not incapable."

Hi, Ive (22F) posted here before. I got my latest sleep study back, and it wasnt good. For once in my life I couldnt sleep. The overnight was horrible and I was awake for two hours in the middle of the night. Apparently I didnt pass the nap test either. My doc called to ask for possible reasons and I told him I was stressed at the time. Honestly I still am. My life is in limbo until I get my sleep figured out. If its not narcolepsy Im scared Ill never get help because I am a mess and I sleep most of my life away.

Anyways I have another test scheduled now. Im redoing just the nap study. I am planning to quit nicotine for good as I believe that could be the problem. I use it to keep me awake and alert but Im also addicted and cant stop. So it probably didnt help the study that it was in my system. 

I have some questions about those diagnosed. Did you sleep walk/talk as a child? And if yes do you still do it as an adult? I used to all the time. My parents called me the demon child because I would hover over them while they slept but I had no memory of it because I was sleep myself.

Just curious if that was a potential symptom to bring up to my doctor or if its just a thing some kids grow out of and isnt related. 

Also another question, have any of you every failed a sleep study but had a second one where you showed symptoms? I feel like every day of my life Im symptomatic to some degree but Ive never been that normal before. I feel like Im once again stressing. I dont want to push a diagnosis that isnt true, but with a family history of it and all the years of researching the condition I feel like I really do fit the criteria. Im just nervous and frustrated with the whole process. 12 years in how many more to go?"

I thought I'd share something I actually managed to internalize recently, as it's helped my brain a little bit.

I often feel incapable of doing things I either know that I have the ability to do, or guilty for not doing all the things all the time because I KNOW I could do them. But instead I do less productive things or half-ass stuff that I could do.

I have the skills to do things. I know this because I function in society (mostly), or have done the things I need/want to do before.

But not doing things due to executive dysfunction isn't a capability issue, it's a capacity issue. 

You are capable, you just don't have the capacity right now. If your phone dies, it's still capable of doing all the things things it's built to do, it just needs to be changed first. Maybe the phone's battery doesn't last long - that just means that you should carry a portable charger or charge it more often. It just needs accommodation to do what it's capable of doing.

Maybe it runs out of batter faster when it's being used a lot or in the cold. Maybe it's fine and lasts a long time in better conditions.

Lack of capacity is a temporary state, even if it lasts a seemingly long time or occurs more frequently than we want.

Separating these two factors has helped me feel a bit less like shit and realize when I need a break. I've always had the knowledge if executive functioning impairment, fatigue from mental health, etc. But it never really 'clicked' until recently. My therapist seemed pretty jazzed that I came to this conclusion, so I thought I'd share.

You are a capable person. You have skills and abilities. You're just tired and your capacity to do them is being depleted by depression/other mental health stuff/crappy situational factors. You are not incapable."

***[PLEASE COMMENT IF YOU HAVE CORRECTIONS!!]***

if you and your doctor suspect you may have narcolepsy, you will most likely be getting a PSG (polysomnogram) followed by an MSLT (multiple sleep latency test). you will be monitored all night and all day (usually until late afternoon) in a bedroom environment wherever testing is held. 

MSL = mean sleep latency. sleep latency is the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep. MSL is the average of these times during each daytime nap. \
SOREMPs = sleep onset REM periods. these are the periods during sleep where you go into REM. the average person does not experience REM during the day. 

**PSG:** after being hooked up to some electrodes for monitoring (heart rate, muscle activity, oxygen saturation, brain activity, potential apnea, etc.), they will have you sleep overnight. this part of your testing is crucial to rule out sleep apnea or other sleep disorders. this is also measuring the efficiency of your sleep. (narcoleptics do not usually have fully restorative sleep.) 

**results to look for:** \
REM sleep latency 15 minutes. other than this parameter, from what i can tell, there arent many clear-cut numbers from the PSG that definitively contribute to a narcolepsy diagnosis. 

**MSLT:** at set periods during the day, they will have you take 4-5 naps every 2 hours and measure most of the same parameters from the PSG while you nap. the naps last about 20-25 minutes. youre going to want to bring some non-screen activities for the downtime. most facilities dont want you looking at a screen 30 minutes before each nap. it is VERY IMPORTANT that you stay awake during this downtime. if you start to drift off, a sleep tech/nurse will alert you via intercom or by coming into the room. if you do end up fully falling asleep, the test is now void, and you will need to repeat the process. 

**results to look for:** \
MSL 8 minutes AND at least 2 SOREMPs. it is typical of narcoleptics to experience REM during daytime naps. our nighttime sleep tends not to be as restorative as it should be, so the brain/body attempts to restore some of that sleep during daytime naps. 

the journey after your sleep study is a long and often frustrating one, but i hope this explanation of the sleep study helps you know whats coming!

Last year I finished my bachelor's degree and now I'm looking for a job as a 3d artist. The problem is that I'm super anxious about having a job. I only worked two times in my life, both times in a 40h job as an intern. While the work was actually kinda interesting at first because I learned a lot of stuff I'm interested in it still got quite boring after two or three month. Both times I had some good colleagues so that wasn't the problem. I also suffer from social anxiety so even thru my colleagues were nice to me it was quite stressful. At the end of most days I felt super exhausted and wouldn't do anything for the rest of the day. I felt like my social life and my hobbies suffered in this time and I don't want this to happen again. Everytime I had a job it was like a hamster wheel that sucked all energy out of me. 
I fear that a job will not make me happy at all and it will kill the only things I still enjoy in life.
It's really frustrating because I know that sooner or later there is no other way and I can't really image a job I would like to do for more then 3 month.
How do other people do this? Work - Life balance never worked out for me but I need it to work out. I know this is some kind of struggle pretty much everyone has to face but in combination with dysthymia it seems even more problematic. 
Finding the right job is obviously the key here but I can't image finding the right one fast. So that means it takes probably years for me which means my social life would kinda die off.

Hey team,

I was diagnosed with Dysthymia years ago, and I've had a couple of therapists, and one psychiatrist. I've had some varied results; I really like the rapport I built with my last therapist, but since she's now on maternity leave, I'm seeing a new therapist, and I'll get to that in a bit.

This is going to be a bit rambly, and I'm sorry, I'm just... debating stuff in my brain.

I'm doing my best at handling my life right now, but of course I have different stressors and circumstances that are going to exacerbate depressive symptoms (plus all the comorbid anxiety/dissociation I experience).

I've been untangling the relationship with my mom (who also just got through surgery for a cancer scare, and has now broken some bones, which has triggered some childhood trauma stuff), I'm in school part-time while working full-time (luckily my school's online and I enjoy my job), and I'm trying to be emotionally supportive to people close to me. It's been tumultuous, especially with the pandemic upending a large number of my coping mechanisms, social outlets, and structure.

There are parts of my life where I'm functional/hyper-functional, like at work or cleaning my house/keeping my environment orderly.

But I'm highly dysfunctional socially. I haven't been able to keep track of time, and I have massive amounts of guilt and anxiety, because I've essentially ghosted all of my close friends since April of this year. I love them, they've always been kind and patient with me when I've done this in the past, but this feels like a really long time, and it's been eating away at me for months.

I had therapy on Tuesday, which also just so happened to be an incredibly stressful day at work, and one where I've also been hormonal (PMS), which tends to make my emotional regulation incredibly difficult and make my depressive symptoms much, much worse (double depression usually happens during this time). So as much as my therapist got an honest picture of me in our last session, she also got one where I was drowning a little, but fully cognizant that the specific, unraveled state that I was in was temporary.

This therapist is still getting to know me, and I worry that she's not as aware of the specific challenges that dysthymia presents, as opposed to other depressive disorders. In some places it's fine, because she challenges me, which is what I need. But it also feels like she makes assumptions, and has a bit of an aggressive undertone, like she's trying to dislodge something. 

We honed in on some of my frustrations, and this session and last session I brought a focus to being completely unable to reach out to my friends, and my self-isolation. And she then suggested  medication.

Now with the pre-amble... here's my dilemma.

I'm very pro-medication... for everyone else. My mom's on meds, and some of my closest friends are on meds - they've been absolutely essential for them to survive. 

But for myself, since I've always managed without medication, it feels like an unnecessary risk. The side effects, like making my depression worse, or weight gain (I've worked incredibly hard to overcome an eating disorder and also to keep my body in a neutral place), feel like, since I'm not really a suicide risk at the moment, they would just... I don't know, throw me out of whack.

I've been in mental health crises that have been much worse, ones where I have been a suicide risk, where I've had symptoms of psychosis and much worse anxiety. I've managed the worst of my own brain without meds, and right now, I know I'm not at my worst.

The science is also still out on the efficacy of medication in the treatment of mild to moderate depression, as opposed to more cognitive/therapeutic approaches. 

And, even with my loved ones on medication, some of the advice I've given them is that ""you can't medicate circumstances"". If things outside of their control are bad, medication won't fix that. Medicating me won't fix the structure that the pandemic removed from me. (But of course, on the other hand, it can help people cope with things being crappy, possibly better than they otherwise would have).

I mentioned my reservations and worry that medication might not be super effective in my circumstance and she said ""if you could have dealt with it cognitively by now, you would have"". And that feels reductionist because what about treatment-resistant depression?

And then something my therapist said kind of gave me pause even more, which is was something to the effect of ""it can help you feel like yourself again"".

The thing is, I do feel like myself. I've had dysthymia for what feels like my whole life. I don't know what self I'd be getting ""back"" to, when I'm already here. I've repeated the patterns of self-isolation over and over again. My spots of dysfunction feel like they're in the same place they've always been. This made me question even more if she knows how to handle a patient with dysthymia, or if she's right and I'm over-reaching with my push-back.

I'm scared to gamble my brain chemistry and the potential side effects therein to get ""back"" to a place that I've never been. I'm worried about all the things that could happen on medication when, right now, I am functional in a lot of places, and if the medication does make my depression worse (even temporarily), I won't even have that.

It feels so far out of my control, but at the same time, I haven't talked to my friends since April. I haven't been functional in a very important place.

I don't know - I guess I wanted to get some perspective from people in the same boat as me. 

If you got this far, thanks for reading."

Hello everyone, so I wanted to provide an update (if anyone cares lol) and felt like sharing. My first post I was in an extremely deep hole regarding my thyroid and overall health. My main concern was my energy levels, hair loss, and extreme difficulty to lose weight. Since going to the doctor, I was officially diagnosed with Hashimotos. However, based on my thyroid function being normal at this time we are just gonna focus on my other symptoms. Come to find out that is common with hashimotos is PCOS which also comes with insulin resistance. SO, all in all after really focusing on getting better, and medication, I am the lowest weight Ive been since this time 2019. I am in such disbelief!!! When I tell you I have never lost this much weight ever in my lifeit makes my eyes swell with tears. Im almost at 30 pounds lost since mid October. My doctor also prescribed me Wellbutrin, as I had some concerns regarding my focus and other unrelated symptoms and I seriously have never felt so amazing in such a long time. I was in such a deep deep deep depression and anxiety ridden, and Im not fully there yet, but its like Im seeing the world through a pair of super clear glasses. I read back on my post and I get filled with emotion because I never thought I would be at the place I am right now. Nearly all of the symptoms I used to experience have diminished since having my medication regimen. I used to have this constant hip pain that would literally incapacitate me for a whole day literally gone as soon as the weight started coming off. I fit in clothes that didnt fit me two years ago. Im glad that I got the courage to seek medical help and get the answers I needed. Hopefully by mid next year, it will be 60 pounds lost!  no fad diets no harmful binge eating/bulimia. Im gaining a healthier relationship with food, my body, and my mind. Thank you for all the sweet comments on my first post. Ill have that linked below (Im sorry Im relatively new to Reddit, so didnt know if there was a better way!)

tldr; I lost nearly 30 pounds in less than three months since going to the doctors and finally have my diagnoses.

hello, I've been struggling with extreme fatigue since i was 16 or so, i started trying to seeking help at 18, but it wasnt until i was 20 that i was finally recommended to see a sleep specialist as most doctors would write it off as my depression. i did an overnight but going of my meds for an accurate MSLT was not an option until now. so ive been """"diagnosed"""" as narcoleptic so that insurance would pay for my armodafonil since we knew that helped. but we want to confirm this diagnosis now.

anyway im a bit nervous for the test, i dont tend to fall asleep for a nap if i know theres a set time limit for sleeping, but thats usually while medicated with 2 stimulants and coffee. Im also worried I'll miss the cut off but barely. idk i just dont wanna leave with more questions than answers.

what things do you wish you knew before your MSLT? 

will video games be okay to bring to keep me busy? or could that be too much stimulation and keep me from napping well?

is it weird if i bring my weighted blanket and a stuffed animal?

obviously im looking at everything my doctor sends but want to here from y'all as well. thanks in advance for reading and/or replying!

...

also a little aside, ive never felt the full force of my narcolepsy for 2 weeks as i have adhd and was already on adderall prior to adding NuVigil. i have to stop both for the two weeks before  i already have time off of work, so it will be interesting to see how much i can nap in the day. but any advice for how to handle these two weeks of fatigue is also appreciated."

I had a sleep study months ago wherein my mean sleep latency was 1.5 minutes and I entered REM sleep in 1.6 minutes after that 4 out of 5 times. I've been dealing with that for the last 6 years, falling asleep all the time, the automatic behaviors, the brain fog, all of it. I nearly failed out of high school because I kept falling asleep during class and never did my homework because I went home and went to bed. I *did* fail out of college because of it. 

I moved states and had to get a new sleep doctor, and they said they need to redo the sleep study and that's allegedly standard practice. In the last month since I've moved, I noticed I've been waking up feeling like I hadn't been breathing, which is completely new to me, so I'd been worried I had developed sleep apnea.

I want to cry and scream and punch something. I was put on stimulants because I have narcolepsy! I've been dealing with this for years! It makes it near impossible to work a job. It made it impossible for me to go through school and get a degree and get the job I want, or hardly any job above retail where I get kicked around and worked to death. It makes it so hard to keep friends. I can't do any of my hobbies. I'm so depressed. And it sucks! It sucks so much that I've been dealing with narcolepsy for so much of my life and now I have apnea on top of it and neither are ever going to go away! It sucks so much and now I have doctors telling me I never had narcolepsy to begin with, like I'm a kid who got on the internet and self diagnosed with no information. I know I have narcolepsy. Why else would my memory be so bad I can't remember what my friends look like, or why I fall asleep while actively making cookies at work? I'm so devastated.

Disclaimer: I have no medical training. I just am a mild cfs sufferer interested in how this disease works.

So, obviously this won't work for everyone because CFS is different between individuals and might not even be a single disease! But it works really well for me and I have been able to push my energy envelope and have less brain fog. It's not a miracle cure though; I still have to pace myself.

One cause of cfs might be damage to metabolism or cellular energy production. The theory behind why NADH would help is that it's kind of like a charged battery for mitochondria where NAD+ is an empty battery. If we have a dysfunction in the process that ""recharges"" NAD+ into NADH it could cause a shortage of NADH and thus low energy. It's a lot more complicated than that but that's my layman's understanding. So, supplementing with NADH should act like a bandaid to the problem but wouldn't fix anything permanently of course.

As for COQ10 I haven't read much about it. I have tried it on its own and it didn't do anything for me. But the studies I looked at tend to test both together, so might as well take both! haha

Another thing, it's really important to take NADH sublingually so it doesn't dissolve in your stomach. I like to take it in the morning before breakfast and let it dissolve and sit there for at least 15-30 mins.


I know this won't work for everyone but maybe some of you will try it and it'll help some. I've also heard that the effects wane over time and you might need to go off of it for a while to get back the full effect.

TLDR: Try it if you can afford to! It may not work for you tho."

I (19F) made an earlier post on here because I recently had a blood test that showed my TSH levels slightly elevated at 6.2 which led me to see my primary care doctor for a full panel of my thyroid. They tested TSH, FT3, FT4, and checked for anti-thyroid antibodies. 

My doctor called today to tell me that the results showed normal levels in everything except my TSH which was elevated at about the same level as before. She wants to put me on 25 mcg Levothyroxine for the high TSH levels but Im very hesitant because Im afraid of over-medicating and having a lot of side effects. 

It was my understanding that Levothyroxine is not always necessary if everything but TSH levels are normal, but I am unsure about this. All of this has seemingly come out of nowhere because the only symptoms I had were depression, trouble sleeping, and menstrual irregularities, but all of these symptoms could easily be due to something else unrelated to my thyroid so I never expected any of this to happen.  

Also, I had a blood test 7 months ago and my TSH levels were normal, and I had all of those symptoms back then too, which makes me question their relation to my thyroid even more. 

Any insight or advice is appreciated!

Edit - this was Benjamin Natelson

Im severe, for reference. Got severe in only a few months. Bedridden 24 a day and crash from reading for more than 20 min. 

The doctor also prescribed compression stockings and liquid salt and abdominal compression garments to help with my POTS (heart rate goes from 75 lying down to 135 standing). So its not like he doesnt believe I have CFS. He did diagnose me with it. And said its partially biological. 

But he did say a lot of it was mental and that lying down is making me worse. That Ive gotten a phobia about doing too much. 

I dont know if its a phobia because .washing my hair makes me crash. Or having my mom wash my hair makes me crash. Or being on a 1 hour phone call makes me crash. OF COURSE IM too scared to walk around the house or walk down the stairs if even these tiny things make me crash!!!! 

And the weird thing is, the crash that made me severe and bedridden (since December) was a result of walking too much in a day. Not resting too much. 

He said something about how lying down makes you deconditioned and has very severe consequences for the body, and I believe it. But guess what, being too active has extremely severe consequences for MY body. Which is worse??? He clearly thinks resting is worse. 

He also asked me if Im religious. When I said no, he said Good. WTF????

He also wants me to double my Lexapro from 10mg to 20 just to see what happens. Lol just in case its mood related. ITS NOT FUCKING MOOD RELATED!!! I was perfectly happy before I crashed to severe!!!! I went from moderate to bedridden OVERNIGHT and that had not a single thing to do with my mood!!!!!

But did the doctor ask ME that? No, he said this to my mother while I was in the other room. 



He also wants me to continue therapy (which I stopped because it was costing me too much energy) because itd help me cope with concerns about doing too much. 

He also said to my mom (I was eavesdropping) that I seemed fine on our one-hour phone call so I cant be as sick as I fear I am.

OF COURSE I SEEMED FINE. I seemed fine when I walked around a museum in December, tooit was only a few days after that that I crashed and became permanently severe and bedridden. Just because someone SEEMS like they can handle the exertion in the moment, doesnt mean there wont be severe PEM consequences afterwards! Its happened to me SO MANY times. 

I was seeing a doctor before this who actually gave me supplements and injections, although the two doctors know each other and dont seem to like each other very much. The supplements werent helping much, but i preferred the old doctors approach because it seemed more scientific and medical and less dont be afraid to do things!!!"

I read r/gout for a couple of years and went through at least 9 bouts of pain, 2-3 of them ""9+"". I became convinced that allo was safe and had few side effects, so started taking 1 year ago. I bought a UASure and tested by UA levels bi-weekly (usually) and recording my perceived pain levels. I'm 6'+ and 200+ so I decided to increase from 300mg to 500mg pretty early and have stayed there, although I'm considering dropping back down to 300mg (mostly because one pill is easier than 3 (300+100+100)).

Yesterday I spoke to a nurse from my neurologists office, and she said Id shared my new insurance information with the receptionist, which I have zero memory of. I even said, nope, I only spoke to you. Your office does not have my new insurance info. But she said they have the new info and she had not spoken to me about it, she insisted their receptionist did. 

The other time was a couple years ago. We visited my husbands grandparents at their apartment unit in a high rise building. I remember walking into the building, and I remember walking into their unit, but I had zero recollection of riding an elevator or walking through their hallway. They were talking about getting a particularly large piece of furniture onto the elevator, and I said What elevator? And my husband said, the one we came up on?

And its not like Im always unhappy either. I enjoy being with my people; but its like as soon as Im away from them and Im by myself everything goes numb again. Ill be smiling on FaceTime with my boyfriend but as soon as we hang up my face goes flat again. And while Im functional at school, my room hasnt been cleaned in a while, Im behind on laundry and dishes, and I cannot for the life of me work up the motivation to get off my phone or my Switch to go and take care of those chores. Ill only start getting those things done if I absolutely have to, and only to the bare minimum for what I need. Sometimes Ill start to feel a bit better, and Ill start getting those things done, but it isnt long before Im back to feeling low and Im falling behind on them again. My good moods dont last long. And Im constantly tired. I slept for nine hours last night and I didnt feel rested at all when I woke up. I also have pretty crappy self esteem. Its like my overall mood is just blah. I have some really good days; but even then there tends to be an undercurrent of a low mood. Im capable of enjoying things, but thats not where my mood stays. Part of me feels like this is normal for me and Im being over dramatic, cause its been this way for a long time. But at the same time, I know that I havent always been this way. As a kid I was very outgoing and happy; it wasnt until my first major depressive episode at 13 that I became so introverted and withdrawn and low. So maybe I do have dysthymia?

Possible inaccuracies notwithstanding, my home testing has suggested a general downward trend in my UA. I started testing in late September after having 2 flares in September. At the same time I completely quit all of my known triggers (salmon, trout) and my possible triggers (seafood, pie) and in fact all animal flesh protein. I already hadn't had a drink since early August (wasn't  a heavy drinker but did like a shot or two of rum most nights). Getting my protein from eggs, nuts and dairy and probably a few other  non-meat things now.  Drinking more milk and a little tart cherry juice most days. Over the last couple weeks I have added wine back in, and that hasn't seemed to affect my UA at all. 

 Since I was flaring much of September my initial readings may have been lower than my normal, but we'll never know. What I do know is

Over the first 2 weeks I averaged 6.9 and a lab test October 4 came back at 6.9

Over the 28 days I averaged 6.5. 

Over the last 2 weeks I averaged 6.1

And today the lab tested me at 6.2. So I seem to have dropped 0.7 mg/dl in 28 days, assuming they are spot-on. (I think they are supposed to be within 0.2)

So despite the limitations of the meter, which I can't seem to rely on for a daily reading, it does seem to mirror the lab results when its all averaged out over longer time frames. The downward trend I seemed to be seeing seems to have been real. 

My big toe is still sore off and on, and I'm having a cortisone injection tomorrow. Its possible I have lasting damage there; my first flare was in March 2017. I am not on allo but allo is on my kitchen counter, ready. Since I have zero family history of gout and I kept notes after all of my flares, I know my triggers pretty well and am going to see if I can get my UA even lower in the next month."

Caveat: I am not diagnosed anything but have a spectrum of symptoms and have been seeing docs for about 18 mos for it. Evaluating for MS, sjogrens, lupus and cfs. I thought this board was most relevant for PEM question. 

Ive been reading clinical descriptions of PEM and they mention the peak being 12-24 hours after activity which is why I have doubt about what it is that I experience. When I do any kind of full body activity, but especially things like gardening/yard work or pushing my son in a stroller for a long periodbasically things that use more than just arms or just legsI have a dramatic crash immediately after the activity. Ive ruled out blood pressure, blood sugar and O2 being the cause. I feel extremely dizzy and need to lay down after the activity. I cant use my arms and legs well during this period, so I have to avoid things like preparing food or typing or even holding a book. Usually the intense feeling will pass in 1/2 to 2 hours and then I just feel tired the rest of the day. It doesnt last into the next day for me. 

The thing that I dont understand about it is that Im not totally out of shape and it is not predictable. I have been able to do 6 mile hikes and feel ok afterwards, or I have been interrupted after 20 mins of gardening.

*Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section, a person with narcolepsy cannot resist falling asleep at inopportune times. These sleep episodes are often associated with cataplexy, which is a lack of muscle tone or muscle weakness, and in some cases involves complete paralysis of the voluntary muscles. This is similar to the kind of paralysis experienced by healthy individuals during REM sleep (Burgess & Scammell, 2012; Hishikawa & Shimizu, 1995; Luppi et al., 2011). Narcoleptic episodes take on other features of REM sleep. For example, around one third of individuals diagnosed with narcolepsy experience vivid, dream-like hallucinations during narcoleptic attacks (Chokroverty, 2010).*

*Surprisingly, narcoleptic episodes are often triggered by states of heightened arousal or stress. The typical episode can last from a minute or two to half an hour. Once awakened from a narcoleptic attack, people report that they feel refreshed (Chokroverty, 2010). Obviously, regular narcoleptic episodes could interfere with the ability to perform ones job or complete schoolwork, and in some situations, narcolepsy can result in significant harm and injury (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery or other potentially dangerous equipment).*

I still don't have an official diagnosis, CFS is the first suspect me and one of my partner gave. I saw a neurologist in December and when I described my symptoms and medical anamnesis and stuff, the first thing she said was you might have CFS. 

One of my main symptoms is: when I go out for a stroll, or for groceries, even after forty minutes out walking and standing, when I sit/get home I'm very fatigued, I have trouble think clearly, follow a verbal conversation, watching anime/TV series. Sometimes it's a bit difficult get up again from the chair/couch and change my clothes. I have to wait a few minutes. Sometimes I am spaced out for hours, sometimes it last a bit less, it depends and I still didn't figure out all the causes. The length of the stroll and how much I stand still might me involved.
I was wondering if it's a CFS symptom or if PEM has to be the next day and not just after the thing"

*Unlike the other sleep disorders described in this section, a person with narcolepsy cannot resist falling asleep at inopportune times.

Narcoleptic episodes take on other features of REM sleep. For example, around one third of individuals diagnosed with narcolepsy experience vivid, dream-like hallucinations during narcoleptic attacks (Chokroverty, 2010).*

*Surprisingly, narcoleptic episodes are often triggered by states of heightened arousal or stress. The typical episode can last from a minute or two to half an hour. Once awakened from a narcoleptic attack, people report that they feel refreshed (Chokroverty, 2010). Obviously, regular narcoleptic episodes could interfere with the ability to perform ones job or complete schoolwork, and in some situations, narcolepsy can result in significant harm and injury (e.g., driving a car or operating machinery or other potentially dangerous equipment).*

I just woke up from a dream where I was back in high school in my strength and conditioning class lifting weights and running. I was so excited to be working out again it felt so good.

How I was going to feel awful, how I was going to be stuck to my bed for the rest of my life.

I know people with even just undergrad science backgrounds who are better suited to doing this kind of work, parsing through lots of papers and looking at the plausibility of a given etiological model, or treatments,  but none that are close enough friends to do it.

But none of them are close enough friends I guess.  But I would consider paying someone if they can deliver.  I believe in citizen science...

t5_2r4lw,syi8op,"I have come accross the theory (video interview link below) that insulin resistance (carb intolerance) is actually caused by too many free fatty acids clogging up the muscles and liver, making them carbohydrate intolerant.","[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","If you have Insulin Resistance (feel like crap after eating carbohydrates) maybe you wanna watch this video interview
I know many of you are dealing with insulin resistance too, feeling like crap after eating a carbohydrate rich food or with actual glucose spikes after carbs.

I am the same and until recently I thought that the best way to manage this was by eating a paleo or ketogenic diet, i.e. cutting down on carbs and eating more protein and fats. I have even suggested it to some of you in comments when you wrote about your troubles metabolizing carbs or feeling like crap after eating in general.

Paleo/keto kind of worked for me after a lot of adaptation. The first time I tried Keto it did destroy me, but later I learned that you have to really take a lot of electrolytes and then it gets better. And it did get better for me with the electrolytes.

I felt ok in ketosis but not great and whenever I would eat a normal amount of carbs my blood glucose would spike really really high and I would feel awful.

I switched to a slow carb based diet (no refined carbs, no sugar but eating starch like legumes, whole grain rice, starchy vegetables) and glutenfree and started to feel a bit better, but was still getting blood glucose spikes after something like an odd banana or potato.

Now I have come accross the theory (video interview link below) that insulin resistance (carb intolerance) is actually caused by too many free fatty acids clogging up the muscles and liver, making them carbohydrate intolerant. When this happens you are insulin resistant. 

Statistics say that approximately 88 % of Americans have some form of insulin resistance which ranges from mild metabolic problems with carbs to full blown diabetes and fatty liver.

In the keto world they say that too much sugar or too many carbs cause insulin resistance and that the solution is to go low carb. This is what I have been doing in the past months. But it didn't resolve my insulin resistance and in fact has made it worse, so that I ended up with a blood glucose spike of 226 (!) after eating 2 medium sized potatoes. I was more insulin resistant than ever. But I avoided symptoms by avoiding too many carbs.

This ""new"" theory I have now found says that the problem is not the carb itself, but the fatty acids clogging up the muscles. 

Good news is you can make yourself insulin senstive again and truly reverse insulin resistance. Not just by avoiding carbs/avoiding symptoms as in paleo/keto/low carb, but by actually becoming tolerant to carbs again.

I am trying this out at the moment and the transition is tricky, I have to say. Because in order to increase carb sensitivity again (which we want) you have to get rid of fats in the diet. All fats, basically.

Which means vegan. No dairy, no eggs, no meat, no fish.

I am the last person to ever believe that going vegan would do me good. Seriously. I didn't believe in it. But I am changing my mind the past few days as I keep diving into this theory and trying it out.

It's not just vegan (for those of you who are reading this and have tried vegan before), but vegan plus low fat (no more than 15 % of daily calory intake) plus no refined sugar/simple carbs like white flour.

And it doesn't mean raw vegan. After the transition when you are insulin sensitive again, you are supposed to be able to eat as many potatoes, sweet potatoes, whole grain rice, millet, oats, starchy veg as you want. Even 700 g of carbs a day. As long as your fat intake is below 15 % of calories.

And it's supposed to reverse so many chronic health problems that are linked to insulin resistance.

I don't know. I am not endorsing this just yet, but it is very interesting to say the least. I am trying it out.

And I thought I will share with you already just in case some of you are intrigued too and want to check out the theory and see if it could work for them too.

I am aware of all the opinions how you need animal protein and need good fats (decent amounts of) etc. etc. for health. I used to be of this opinion too (like last week still). This new theory blows my mind. It makes so much sense in my illness biography, I can't even tell you.

So I just want to share this info. Personally, not looking for a discussion on how fats are good for you and keto is the way to go. But feel free to start such discussion. It's just that I don't want to get involved in it. 

I am posting this merely to share the info and link in case it resonates with some of you and you want to look into it.

Hi everyone, it's my first post here and I've discovered this sub only this morning doing some resarch.

I've found out about dysthymia around one year ago. I've sufferend with EDs, depression, anxiety and self-harm in the past. In the last 5/6 years is like my mind is giving up and slowly shutting down. I have not energy, no movitation, I'm always tired and can't do much during the day.

Just an example!). 

Dysthymia really resonated with me.
But at the same time I have the same old voice telling me I don't feel bad enough, that I'm just lazy and should just change my lifestyle. Even when I suffered with a bad period of depression it took a while before I realised it because I'm so used to feeling bad that it's the norm. I have sprouts of energy but they don't last and I'm always back at square one.

I was thinking about going on antidepressants. I don't want to waste my life trying to get better by myself and get old without succeeding. I want a rich and full life, not an empty torment. I think antidepressants may help giving me the energy and motivation I need. I found some informationz about Wellbutrin and I think it may be the right one for me.

I am the same and until recently I thought that the best way to manage this was by eating a paleo or ketogenic diet, i.e. cutting down on carbs and eating more protein and fats. I have even suggested it to some of you in comments when you wrote about your troubles metabolizing carbs or feeling like crap after eating in general.

Paleo/keto kind of worked for me after a lot of adaptation. The first time I tried Keto it did destroy me, but later I learned that you have to really take a lot of electrolytes and then it gets better. And it did get better for me with the electrolytes.

I felt ok in ketosis but not great and whenever I would eat a normal amount of carbs my blood glucose would spike really really high and I would feel awful.

I switched to a slow carb based diet (no refined carbs, no sugar but eating starch like legumes, whole grain rice, starchy vegetables) and glutenfree and started to feel a bit better, but was still getting blood glucose spikes after something like an odd banana or potato.

Now I have come accross the theory (video interview link below) that insulin resistance (carb intolerance) is actually caused by too many free fatty acids clogging up the muscles and liver, making them carbohydrate intolerant. When this happens you are insulin resistant. 

Statistics say that approximately 88 % of Americans have some form of insulin resistance which ranges from mild metabolic problems with carbs to full blown diabetes and fatty liver.

In the keto world they say that too much sugar or too many carbs cause insulin resistance and that the solution is to go low carb. This is what I have been doing in the past months. But it didn't resolve my insulin resistance and in fact has made it worse, so that I ended up with a blood glucose spike of 226 (!) after eating 2 medium sized potatoes. I was more insulin resistant than ever. But I avoided symptoms by avoiding too many carbs.

This ""new"" theory I have now found says that the problem is not the carb itself, but the fatty acids clogging up the muscles. 

Good news is you can make yourself insulin senstive again and truly reverse insulin resistance. Not just by avoiding carbs/avoiding symptoms as in paleo/keto/low carb, but by actually becoming tolerant to carbs again.

I am trying this out at the moment and the transition is tricky, I have to say. Because in order to increase carb sensitivity again (which we want) you have to get rid of fats in the diet. All fats, basically.

Which means vegan. No dairy, no eggs, no meat, no fish.

I am the last person to ever believe that going vegan would do me good. Seriously. I didn't believe in it. But I am changing my mind the past few days as I keep diving into this theory and trying it out.

It's not just vegan (for those of you who are reading this and have tried vegan before), but vegan plus low fat (no more than 15 % of daily calory intake) plus no refined sugar/simple carbs like white flour.

And it doesn't mean raw vegan. After the transition when you are insulin sensitive again, you are supposed to be able to eat as many potatoes, sweet potatoes, whole grain rice, millet, oats, starchy veg as you want. Even 700 g of carbs a day. As long as your fat intake is below 15 % of calories.

And it's supposed to reverse so many chronic health problems that are linked to insulin resistance.

I don't know. I am not endorsing this just yet, but it is very interesting to say the least. I am trying it out.

And I thought I will share with you already just in case some of you are intrigued too and want to check out the theory and see if it could work for them too.

I am aware of all the opinions how you need animal protein and need good fats (decent amounts of) etc. etc. for health. I used to be of this opinion too (like last week still). This new theory blows my mind. It makes so much sense in my illness biography, I can't even tell you.

So I just want to share this info. Personally, not looking for a discussion on how fats are good for you and keto is the way to go. But feel free to start such discussion. It's just that I don't want to get involved in it. 

I am posting this merely to share the info and link in case it resonates with some of you and you want to look into it.

Here's a link to an interview on how this is supposed to work: [https://youtu.be/l1rebfIqpfY](https://youtu.be/l1rebfIqpfY)

Hi everyone, it's my first post here and I've discovered this sub only this morning doing some resarch.

I've found out about dysthymia around one year ago. I've sufferend with EDs, depression, anxiety and self-harm in the past. In the last 5/6 years is like my mind is giving up and slowly shutting down. I have not energy, no movitation, I'm always tired and can't do much during the day. I have dreams I want to achieve but no drive to work on them. When I do something I would enjoy in the past I don't feel much, it's like I'm somewhere else. I hear people in their 60s saying they miss the energy they had at my age and I see other 20-somethings being so active doing so much stuff and I wonder whether I'm 60s inside already (nothing against people in their 60s! Just an example!). 

Dysthymia really resonated with me.
But at the same time I have the same old voice telling me I don't feel bad enough, that I'm just lazy and should just change my lifestyle. Even when I suffered with a bad period of depression it took a while before I realised it because I'm so used to feeling bad that it's the norm. I have sprouts of energy but they don't last and I'm always back at square one.

I was thinking about going on antidepressants. I don't want to waste my life trying to get better by myself and get old without succeeding. I want a rich and full life, not an empty torment. I think antidepressants may help giving me the energy and motivation I need. I found some informationz about Wellbutrin and I think it may be the right one for me. What's your opinion about Wellbutrin? Did it help?"

Hey guys,

I was recently diagnosed with Hypothyroidism and now going to get updated blood and ultrasound on my neck. I have a noticeable goiter on my neck and I am a little nervous because I just don't know the outcome of the ultrasound.

But besides that, the fatigue is killing me. I can't really sleep at nights no matter how hard I try and even if I sleep for seven or eight hours, I'm still extremely tired. I am also experiencing mild memory/brain fog.

I don't know if this is part of Hypothyroidism, but my hair hasn't been growing at the rate I know it can. I only read that Hypo can cause extreme shedding and/or hair loss. I'm not experiencing either, just slow hair growth and a bit of dryness/brittle hair.

I also gained maybe a total of 28lbs. I'm 5'8 and typically 134. I'm now 166. I was 170 and w/o being medicated I was able to lose 3lbs. I don't entitely expect to go back to my 130s, but I am experiencing very stubborn stomach fat. I'm also always bloated and constipated.

I just want to know what to expect. Will the medication cause drastic weight loss? I don't want to rapidly lose weight. I just want to lose about 10lbs. I also heard that despite being medicated I could also continue to gain weight so I'm a little confused?

Will the medication help with my fatigue and regulate my sleep?

Will the medication help my hair growth?

Also, can I still take maca root with thyroid medication? It helps with my acne, so I'll be a bit sad if I can't use it anymore.

I'm just a bit anxious is all. The diagnoses really just overwhelmed me and I just want to know what to look forward to. Thank you.~"

First off- this sub has been so helpful in getting me educated on this.  You guys are awesome.

So about 2 weeks ago, I was at scout camp with my kid for the week with what I thought was tendinitis.  It was supposed to be a relaxing week for me to hike, and fish etc  while my kid worked on his merit badges.  Instead I was trapped in my tent for a week in crippling pain with what I know now was a gout attack.  

Initially my toe was a bit swollen.  Had I known it was gout, I could have avoided the food at the mess hall all week: red meat non stop among other just bad food choices.  I also ended up decreasing my water intake as I was stuck in a tent, and getting up and out to pee was extremely challenging.  You can guess what happened by the end of the week.  My entire foot was swollen.  Levels of swelling I'd never seen before...Fred Flintstone level foot.  I was in agony.

When I got home I ran to urgent care thinking I needed a brace.  I got the gout diagnosis, and was sent home on prednisone and colchicine.  I've since been eating clean, avoiding red meat/shellfish, and drinking a gallon of water a day.  I took my last Prednisone this past Sunday and my foot looks great.  The swelling is gone in my foot overall, however, my foot still feels crampy after all that trauma.  Yesterday,  I tried my sneakers on and I was surprised at how painful it was.  It wasn't the attack type of pain, but it hurt.  

How long does it take to fully recover from a full fledged week long attack?"

[Nonpharmacological Management of Gout and Hyperuricemia: Hints for Better Lifestyle](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/)

Folks it's articles like this that I think cause a lot of confusion on gout.  People come here looking for ways to avoid being on life long medication or how to mitigate pain or how to stop a flare.  This article points to a lot of the things people try to control gout flares that aren't drugs.  Please understand control of uric acid levels - when talking about gout means keeping your UA levels lower than 6mg/dL (5 if you have tophi) and keeping it there.  Everything else is trying to stop gout flaring - your immune system response to monosodium urate crystals.

[Why does the gout attack stop? A roadmap for the immune pathogenesis of gout](https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/1/Suppl_1/e000046)

In reality you have probably been hyperuricemic for quite some time (years) as uric acid isn't usually tested unless there is an issue.  Monosodium urate crystals have been building up in your joints.  Then one day you stub your toe or eat that trigger food that causes inflammation - and you have a gout flare.  You take anti-inflammatories(NASID) and/or immunosuppressants(colchicine) to stop your immune system response.  At some point the immune system may stop and the crystals get sheathed - until you stub your toe again or eat that foot that causes inflammation.  Rinse/Repeat.  The gout flares ebb and flow with your immune system response - not with crystals coming and going.  When you go onto a Urate lowering therapy it could be months to years before all the crystals dissolve - even though your uric acid is held low.  6 months after I had my UA levels at 5.5mg/dL - I still flared which means that there were still MSU crystals present.  Controlling serum uric acid levels needs to be a constant low - with a threat of flaring anyway as the crystals dissolve and the sheaths get disturbed.  Eating your way to a low enough serum acid level is difficult in my experience.  

FTA (Nonpharmacological Management) - emphasis is mine

>Since uric acid is an end-product of purine metabolism in humans, it is reasonable to suggest that excessive ingestion of purine-rich foods causes an increase in serum uric acid. In fact, ingestion of RNA (corresponding to 225 mg purine/kg of body weight) increased plasma uric acid by **0.74 mg/dL,** indicating that excessive consumption of purine increases plasma uric acid concentration.[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/#bibr23-1559827615601973) However, not all purine-containing foods have the same effect on serum uric acid level and gout risk.

&#x200B;

>**A purine-rich diet for 1 to 2 weeks produces only a small transient rise in serum uric acid level of 1 to 2 mg/dL, while an isocaloric low-purine diet for 7 to 10 days will slightly reduce serum uric acid by about 1 to 2 mg/dL**.[30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/#bibr30-1559827615601973),[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125106/#bibr31-1559827615601973) **suggesting that strict restriction of consumption of purine is not practical or effective for uric acid control.** Accordingly, adequate calorie intake and weight management with moderation of meat and seafood in the diet has been recently recommended for gout/hyperuricemia subjects.

This has been my experience.  On the extreme end - on a keto/low carb high fat diet (LCHF) - I have lost a lot of weight \~50lbs down now - and have dropped my serum acid levels from 5.5mg/dL to 4.5mg/dL.  In addition I eat a lot of high purine foods - red meat, anchovies, shellfish.  I am just one person but I am adding my anecdotal evidence that it isn't purine ingestion that causes serum acid levels to rise.  My best guess is the reduction of sugar is the reason for my decrease in serum acid levels - from some of the other articles I have read.

[Fructose Intake, Serum Uric Acid, and Cardiometabolic Disorders: A Critical Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5409734/)

TL;DR - My take - Gouty Arthritis is curable - by lowering your UA levels low enough for MSU crystals to dissolve.  Hyperuricemia is manageable through daily ULT medication.  Eating and supplementation typically only addresses flaring (Gouty Arthritis) - not Hyperuricimea (UA levels > 6.8mg/dL)

TL;DR2 - Do everything you can to lose weight, be healthy, eat right, stay hydrated - these are all good things - but do not be discouraged if you can't control your gout with these things.  There are safe and effective drugs that have been FDA tested and approved."

im in the processing of figuring out if i have cataplexy or not. not being in tune with my emotions does not help my ability to notice it happening. however i took some shrooms last night and noticed, i have much less control over my muscles than my partner who often trips with me. given the emotional nature of the drug, i was wondering if there could be a connection, that psychedelics can trigger cataplexy. 

i was feeling great and laughing but there were several times i could not keep my head up  or felt weak, and i often did not have much fine motor control- putting in ear buds was a challenge. im wondering if i should bring this up to my sleep specialist.

so, just curious about those who have cataplexy and done psychedelics, does it make it worse for you?"

I started having panic attacks two years ago. I was driving home after dropping my daughter off and suddenly felt like I was going to pass out, which resulted in a panic attack. And I've been having them ever since.

When I went to my GP about possible narcolepsy, she blamed my symptoms on my anxiety (I've been struggling to find the right medication to get it under control). But I wonder if it's the other way around. 

I've long felt that my panic attacks are a symptom of something greater, so when my sleep doctor told me that my sleep issues could be causing my anxiety and panic, I felt so seen. Narcolepsy messed up REM sleep, which can increase emotional reactivity and lead to anxiety disorders. 

And another reason anxiety can develop is because people with narcolepsy fear having no control over their bodies. And this fear is exactly why I do not drink or do any drugs. I *hate* not being in control of my body. 

So does anyone else have this? If so, did narcolepsy treatment improve your anxiety?

This response is also in play when animals feel threatened: their natural reaction is to try to look bigger than their attacker, so their skin and hair expand to play up that effect.

The arrector pili muscle is a source of information when evaluating a skin biopsy since it is well-innervated with autonomic nerves that control when the muscle contracts. 

Sooo, I thought it was some sort of tightening of muscles. And I think this arrector pili muscle is what is clenched. This makes sense considering it does feel like when you get that random shiver. It's like half of that shiver.

I thought I had read a long time ago that those shivers are your spinal fluid being cleared from the nerve endings. And I suppose that could still be true that it is related somehow.

Ive never been diagnosed nor have I been to a therapist before, but Ive been reading up on these post for the past few days and it really sounds like my current experience wasnt an isolated one to begin with. Dont know if I should be speculating if I have it or not but I really dont want to self-diagnosis, especially since dysthymia isnt as well-informed beyond mild but longer depression and I dont want to be wrong about something thats susceptible to misinformation, so just wanna clear the air theres a chance I may not have it, so take what I say with a grain of salt 

But Ive been feeling a low range of emotions for almost a year now, and if my memory is correct I also began to question myself because suddenly I couldnt define myself (?). Like when I was younger I could list off traits like being selfless and nice, and works hard and tries despite knowing I sucked at the things I did. Even when I went through depression I could make a list of traits that defined me (albeit they were mainly just me calling myself a mistake and a waste of space). 

But when my emotions dwindled to what they are now, I cant seem to do that anymore. I cant even say Im a shitty human being without feeling like theres this wall between me and my identity. I dont have depersonalization cause I dont have out-of-body experiences but at the same time I dont really feel like myself, or anyone else for that matter. In fact, I dont feel anything, which sucks because for the longest time I have no idea how to put that into words for it to make sense, and still am to this day. I guess the best I can describe it is feeling like a shell of a person, or just pure nothingness. 

My speculation is that its probably the lack of emotions mixed in with no motivation for passions or even care for passions anymore. Weirdly enough when it first started happening I was desperate to get what I once had back, and I remember spending months pretending to be those list of traits and passions again until it took way too much of my energy and I stopped. I cant tell if I grown up to a different person or grown away to a different person to be honest 

Is this something common here? I cant get a therapist to get a diagnosis (parents wont allow me so Im waiting until Im 18 so I dont need their consent) but the identity thing has been bothering me for the past year and this community has been the closest thing to relating to my experiences so far"

I failed again yet everytime I learn more about how I react and pretty much how bulimics feel and how to recover from this ! I can do it but slower than I thought ! That's a long story short though, now for the details

For some days I did not binge neither purge but today I ate a small amount of sweets the home had and the idea to buy binge food and bought it with a poor excuse, finding 5  down the road if you are curious, and had thoughts that I wasn't really really hungry but went after it anyway and runned to the supermarket happy as fuck like bad old days and got something like nuttela but cheaper granola milk a huge croissant bigger than my head and biscuits like a box with 0,5 kgs of it (1,1 pounds) 

As I was eating I felt satiety but I continued eating until I finished one box of cereal but trust me I didn't eat until I was stuffed but I felt that I want way more food now than before cause I fucked everything for months and yeah I did purge and very successfuly as well I almost spill water flushing the water for the first time ever and remember I wasn't even stuffed so yeah I subconsciously eat more to feel satiety ! I'm like I'm doing eating challenge exercise if you think about it 

But feeling satiety eating like that felt weird someday I'll probably stop but purging so successfully makes it very hard and there is leftover in my house ! One day I had the question what is the worst Ed someone could have ? Well it always depends on the person and how it reacts to the disorder ! I felt like complete and utter shit being close to underweight ! It was not addicting at all , pure binging made me want to vomit cause I couldn't sleep and bulimia ... Only long term side effects and health issues are problematic, but I care about that as much as smokers care for long term side effects Wich is ""not enough to want to change"" so yeah addictions mess everything up suddenly are the worst in my opinion

t5_2rhx3,r4ds20,I was misdiagnosed up until my senior year.,"[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","When did it start for you?
I started falling asleep in class in 3rd grade. By my junior year of high school I was falling asleep walking between classes. I fell asleep taking the ACT test that same year, fell asleep playing violin in orchestra class, and right when getting home from school I would a lot of the time just get right back into bed and sleep until the next day I needed to go to school. The sleep attacks were so bad, just uncontrollable. I stopped eating in the middle of meals to sleep, sometimes just skipping lunch to sleep in the band room. In anatomy class we dissected a cat (I know, sad), and I fell asleep face first into the dead ass cat. I got sent home that day. Failed 2 classes, almost didnt graduate. Straight up the most vivid dreams too in the time it took me to walk between classes. My sister would help me. 

They thought it was depression. I was misdiagnosed up until my senior year. Ridiculous, looking back on it. I fell asleep on a DEAD CAT. No shit I was depressed. In my senior year they put me on an anti-depressant in response. Finally saw the sleep doc. Sleep study. Typical case of narcolepsy 2. Prescribed provigil but that was back when insurance wouldnt cover it because there was no generic form yet. $240 a month. I was still in high school then. My parents (divorced): mom couldnt afford. Dad still doubted my diagnoses, to the extent he STILL wanted to believe it wasnt narcolepsy. So I went to see a psychiatrist, was just put on a stimulant instead. Thats helped enough where I dont fall asleep like this anymore. My diagnosis was almost 10 years ago, and Ive never been on medication designed specifically for narcolepsy, which hasnt been too much an issue but some days I still sleep 20 hours, and go on three day benders about every 3 months of sleeping 22 hours a day 3 days straight.

After nearly a year of waiting I finally saw a rheumatologist. After an ultrasound of my foot, x-rays, and blood work, she thinks I don't have gout - despite the fact that my blood levels of uric acid were high before symptoms came along (7-8), despite my reactivity to certain foods and alcohol, and despite my big left toe being the area of flares. To be fair, my symptoms had not gone away after 7-8 months of allo (blood level was 5 to 5.5 consistently for the 7-8 months)... I know for some people it takes a long time.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? The reviews for this rheumatologist do mention cases of people who'd taken gout medications for years who actually had something else. Is gout often mis-diagnosed?"

Its been found that only 20 percent of people with high uric acid have gout and its highly genetic. Nobody in my family has gout uptill now. So my chance of gout is pretty low.

Apparantly I've come to know that high uric acid is much more than just gout. Its a really big indicator of health risks like diabetes, heart disease,etc. my blood sugar is little higher than normal and I suspect it is because of high uric acid.

I consulted a general physician and he advised me to drink 4-5 litres a day and it would decrease by 2 points in about 6 months. But I want to decrease it faster because somewhere in my heart I'm still afraid of gout. Is it possible. Is it just 1 time or should I keep on using medications?

Hey all, just wanted to unload a little bit. I had a Total Thyroidectomy back in March '21. After 8 weeks of adjustments, I noticed I was exhibiting symptoms that the surgeon alerted me about to keep an eye on. These symptoms aligned with hypothyroidism. I also happen to have diagnosed depression. I brought symptoms up to them (persistent cold, groggy, fatigue, brain fog, weight gain, dry skin, drastic menstrual changes) and was waved off - they said my levels were within range (didn't tell me what they were) and that changes were normal. 

Fast forward a few months and my symptoms have worsened and I have gained new ones. I make the assumption that it can't be my thyroid stuff, and that they were caused by depression. There's a *lot* of overlap between symptoms of depression and hypothyroidism. In fact, depression in and of itself *is* a symptom. At this point, 10 months post surgery, they have not followed up, requested any test results, or any general information seeking beyond the first 8 week checkup. So for 8 months, I have been on this same dose. I just happened to get a blood check today with my regular doctor at a yearly checkup. They noted that my prescription dose seemed quite odd and I guess some things didn't quite line up with my general health checkup, so they ordered the test and took the initiative to send it to my surgeon's office. I only recently got the phone call from the nurse who informed me of my levels (currently at 27, should be between 0.4-4) and proceeded to walk me through the next steps. 

On one hand, I'm relieved to know there's a potential answer to so many of the issues I've been having. I hope I get to feeling closer to normal in the next few weeks. On the other hand, I'm frustrated and angry that I let this go unchecked for so long. This goes to show that you definitely need to be a strong advocate for your own health."

I've been also off my effexor for my upcoming sleep study as it affects rem sleep as well. What I've noticed is that my cataplexy has gotten worse as well as my sleep attacks have gotten strong since stopping effexor.   

My question is should I expect the same with stopping weed? I had expected more vivid dreams but if it'll make my cataplexy and sleep attacks even worse, I'm hesitant to stop smoking. I promised my doctor tho that I'd stop 2 weeks before my test. 

Should I be prepared that for those two weeks my symptoms will get worse? Has anyone else been in this situation with canabis and if so, how did you react when stopping?

- hair loss, swollen face, (these symptoms have been happening for about 6th months but these -> showed up around October) Dry incredibly itchy skin no matter how much I moisturized, joint pain which has never happened before, and constipation for the ones I can recall. After research, I realized I had swapped out iodized salt for sea salt for about a year, and I dont consume seafood and consume limited dairy. Could this have given me an iodine deficiency leading to an under active thyroid? I started using iodized salt again and Im pretty sure my face went down, and my dad agreed. The question is if I should contact my doctor about this, or would it just be reversed by incorporating that salt again if it is hypothyroidism.

So I guess my questions are:

* Am I crazy? Or is it valid that 2.96 still may be too high? 
* Is there any lag of symptoms improving? I've been on this dose for 8 weeks, is there a chance existing symptoms will get better without a change in medicine?
* Do people just never get back to 100%?

","[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":124,""label"":""population"",""startOffset"":114}]}}]","If only I wish I could get my libido back, its been 13 years
Im 32f. I havent been diagnosed, but I think Ive had dysthymia since I was 18. 

It started slowly. I had just graduated high school, and was dating my first ever boyfriend. It all began when I started to feel less excited about seeing him. I thought it was the honeymoon period coming to an end, after only a couple of months dating. 

(Btw I dont think this had to do with high school ending. High school was miserable for me, I was unpopular, ugly, and had only a few friends. HS was disappointment after disappointment, socially. I was glad it was over.)


But then everything started feeling less and less exciting, especially starting college. For a few months I barely ate, slept a lot, cried a lot. Then I stopped feeling so sad, but I started feeling blank? Like nothing? By this point, I had no libido. Nothing whatsoever. 

Its never returned. A few times I can count with the fingers in one hand Ive felt some arousal. But fantasizing or doing stuff just doesnt give me any pleasure, which sucks, as it turns sex into a chore. I feel robbed cause when I lost my sex drive Id only become sexually active a few months prior. I feel robbed because throughout my 20s I had less sex than I could have, and what sex I had I didnt enjoy, I was very attractive and it was for nothing.

I feel attracted to people, just on a very rational level if it makes sense. Its like I see someone and I know if I didnt have this problem Id be feeling all kinds of tingling going on downstairs. I fantasize about these guys, but get no arousal and therefore cant masturbate to orgasm, i.e. i get frustrated.

Im married, too. My husband has a veeery high sex drive and we have sex every day. Feels like a chore, but I do it because Im afraid to lose him if I dont (I fake all the time). This makes me sad, as I wish I could genuinely enjoy it (early in the relationship I did feel some very muted arousal, enough that he could make me come and to know that hes great at sex). I guess I also do it for the intimacy. 

I love my husband, though, again, this is more of a rational feeling. I did cry like a baby when we got married and that day, everything felt like it was right with the world. I was so sure of that decision, I was surprised, because I second, triple guess every fucking decision I manage to make (I barely make decisions, if I can get someone else to decide, I always let them).

I feel passionless, not just about sex... there are things I like, but cant seem to enjoy them much, practically all the time. But if I could get passion for just one thing, I wish it was for sex. I miss feeling horny. I spent all adolescence thinking about sex, waiting for the time Id be sexually active, and then when I began having sex bam! I lost the drive.

I used to watch a lot of porn when I was a teen, and sometimes I think it might be that I got an addiction. But I never was like addicted addicted, I could and can function fine without porn. I do use it from time to time to masturbate; I can orgasm but its difficult to get there and feels meh afterward. I can go without for months though. Makes no difference. I think I do have some sort of conditioning going on, but like I said, I dont feel addicted. Also it doesnt explain all the other stuff (being unable to decide, brain fog, no passion for anything, extremely negative thoughts, very catastrophic thinking/anxiety and panic attacks).

I distinctly remember ONE time that my sex drive came back unexpectedly. I was 23 and had gone for a long weekend to this camp/party getaway where we were partying 24/7 in the woods, not a care in the world. This guy Id known for a while (but didnt really feel especially attracted to) was dancing with me, kissed me and suddenly I felt totally turned on, like the old times. That was 9 years ago however, which is sad. Ive only felt mildly aroused a few times after that, with my husband. Thats it. Even with other guys I was really attracted to I felt nothing.

Ive never felt attracted to other women, by the way... 



Sorry this was rambley and long... thanks if you read all this. I wish there was a magic pill which could cure us all...

Is there anything that can help in getting my libido back?

I feel like being unable to ever enjoy sex again is such a miserable thing... makes me really scared. I must add that deep down, I dont feel like this is the real me."

When I would rest for a day or two off my feet, no stress, I would begin to feel better. 

After a while, it got too much I couldnt get up out of bed and the swelling wouldnt go away as fast, and then my body just felt weak and sore.

Going out for dinner or at night hasnt happened often at all, if it has, its been a few times and not too late. 

Ive recently had some weird flare up, where I believe it could be severe anxiety/stress on my body which could be what is wrong. In November last year I woke up so swollen, pale, skin broken out, hormones must have been crazy coz I was craving only heavy carbs, began having insomnia, anxiety became worse. Its not feb and my swelling has come down and it only went down the minute I took an antidepressant, like it reduced all the stress in my body. I then stopped the antidepressant because of side effects, and have been waking up every morning in panic attacks, not able to have deep sleeps because my mind wont stop, so tired all I can do is go for a walk in the morning and then rest all day on the couch. I feel like my body is slowly healing, and I believe I have fatigue of some form but I still wonder if its all to do with anxiety and stress. 

Before I got sick I was in a toxic relationship that stressed my body so much and I knew I was deteriorating. But the body swelling is still unexplainable, blood tests show nothing. Im also really sensitive to sounds now..not sure if thats just when Im really tired."

I've developed chronic fatigue from when I had mono when I was 19. I think quite a few things have also contributed to my CFS. 

When I had mono, it was around Halloween and I was drinking. I was a dumb college kid that didn't know you aren't supposed to drink when you have mono (to be honest, I probably wouldn't have cared if I did know any better). I look back and think that the drinking when I had mono is what contributed to my chronic fatigue, even if it was for the one night.

Another thing is when I was in college, I was a student athlete for a division I school. I was running between 45-50 miles a week. Although when our personal trainers found out I had mono, I was instructed to take 6 weeks off from running. This was the most time I have ever had off from running. We ran for 3 seasons a year, and had one week off between each season. We ran every day of the week and never had a day off. Towards the end of my running career, I was running up to 60 miles a week with intense workouts in between, running twice a day most days. 

I also have CPTSD that didn't I didn't show symptoms of until I was 21. I'm 25 now and every day is a struggle. I live with regret and guilt about drinking when I had mono. But maybe there were multiple things that contributed to my chronic fatigue, who knows.

Im new here and just read up on the resources made for newly diagnosed people. I saw that some organizations were listed that you should avoid, one of them being recovery norway.

All i know about that is that some doctors in norway came out and claimed the lightning method was harmful bacuse it was not scientifically proven. But i saw some people desrcibe it as cultlike, yet the website claimed to be nonprofit and not based around group meetings, which doesnt sound cultlike? I would love to hear more about this since i think the fact that they claim thought pattern alone can provide recovery is a bit worrying.


EDIT: i just fell down a rabbit hole now holy cow. I reccomend the blog melivet.com for a thorough critique of the organization, its leaders and its practises. Henrik Vogt is actively preventing people, such as this blogger, from making public critiques about RN and the lightning method, as well as trying to stop research that will negatively affect his business.

My insulin levels were at 12.8 and my testosterone at 39 for reference. I am getting an ultrasound on Monday.

I'll be 31 in a couple weeks and just had a physical and regular blood work with abnormal TSH results.

My **TSH is at 9.23** **mIU/L** and my **Free T4 is (REF)1.0** **ng/dL.**

Like I had gotten off birth control so I assumed that's why I have acne now. Since the pandemic I work remotely, so I thought that's why my weight has stayed the same and no matter how much I work out I don't really lose weight. I am 5'7 and 160lb so I can't say weight was a huge symptom, just noticed I can't lose it when trying and I eat well. I thought feeling fatigued was due to depression/pandemic and other life changes/losses. My muscles being weaker I just thought I was getting older. I snowboard and it has been really hard and I don't feel like my old self. My hair has also thinned out but I thought it was just damaged from bleaching it awhile back.

I'm so glad there's an answer and treatment to this, because although these symptoms were subtle, I have not enjoyed them of course and thought it was just life. I just don't understand if I'll have to be on medication for life now or what to expect?"

I hope that I am going to make it. So... Day 1 (at least here)
Hello, I am an 18 yo student from Europe. For the last 2 years I felt absolutely nothing. This was fucking exhausting 'cause, before all this I was very goal oriented, good student with many hobbies. I was not very social, and well... This triggered the whole situation . 

For the last year I was trying to find wtf was wrong with me. I couldn't understand. How tf this happened to me. I was so emotional, I had so many ambitions and now... I was nothing. I had nothing. No friends no emotions.  

After a lot of search I discovered a term called apathy. It was pretty much what I was feeling about. In every site that was about apathy the author always linked it to depression, but I was like, no I don't have depression. Of course, the truth was that I didn't want to have depression. In my mind depression was the worst thing that could happen to an individual. Well, my belief was, as you expect, wrong. I believed all these because of the stigma that surrounds depression. I didn't want to be weird. 

Ok so, after a while I thought. Ok I might not have depression, but what about the cure of depression fits the cure for apathy. They look alike, right? 

So yeah... To make all this shorter, about in November, I discovered the term of dysthymia. And I understood, that it fitted everything. Yes, I self diagnosed myself, but ... I mean it's the only thing that fitted perfectly. It's either that or a higher power that wants me to suffer long term. (Full metal jacket, anyone?)

Also to this point I'd like to say that I wish I had the money to go to therapy. But since I am broke and I am still in high school, I have no other option other than trying to find a solution to this. I want to go to the university, and if I don't cure my depression, I won't. And that's something that I DON'T WANT.

Somewhere, I don't exactly remember where, I found a person to suggest a book of Judith Beck, Cognitive Behavior Therapy. So, I bought that book in my language. It's basically a guide for therapists on how to give treatment to a patient. It's very helpful. I understood many things about how depression is formed. I don't know how to give the outline in this book since english is not my first language, but I' ll use this book as my guide. 

I make this post to motivate both myself and other people that want to get out of this situation. The truth is that I am in the correct way, when I don't want to give up, and when I try to respond to my automatic thoughts and dysfunctional beliefs I feel good. I have motivation to do things. But because I am still in the beginning It's normal to go through times where all this that I am sceptical about what I am trying to do, it's crazy from someone's else perspective and it feels difficult. But I am going to try. I am not going to lose a war without even giving a battle. 

My main fear is the fear of the feeling of boredom. I hate this feeling with a burning desire. For me it's the most difficult thing that you have to go through when you are depressed. Cause you feel that nothing can change that. BUT I want to give a tip, if anyone's interested. I came to the realization that if you think that it's just a feeling and there are many ways to overcome it, I feel like I can beat that emotion! I know, it's not really an advice or something but, I hope that someone of you can also come to this realization and finally find a way to feel better. 

I don't want to give up. I am saying that because if someone's want to discourage me, please don't. I don't say that with grudge or something. I say that because I prefer to stay with a delusion that gives me motivation, other than a realization that makes me even more depressed. I want to commit in this sub because I feel the urge to change and here there are people that understand me. And I want to make it! I want to be happy and meet my goals and ambitions. 

Thank you for coming to this journey, I hope that I won't disappoint both you and myself. 

If you have any tips, please post them here, I definitely need advice.

Im not diagnosed with dysthymia but Ive been on this sub for a while and resonate with everything (if you feel like the below is not dysthymia, then comment what you think it is). Just doing this since Im extremely bored (Im currently at Stage 2) and Ive already gone to bed but its only 8pm. Just a heads up that it could be a little triggering (mention of sh, suicide ideation). Without further ado:

1. All my work is done. Im feeling positive, hopeful, driven. I am actively doing my routine twice a day skincare and brushing my teeth. My mind is abuzz with all the things I want to do. I want to sing, I want to learn how to dance, heck, lets learn how to play my mothers guitar! I start a 8-week couch to 5k running challenge. Its not punishment, I actually am genuinely interested and want to challenge myself to overcome my asthma. Im not depressed. Ive never been depressed. Sure, two days ago I thought about killing myself but today is a new day. In fact, did that even happen? I cant seem to understand why Id even think about that. In the back of my mind, a voice I pretend not to hear asks I wonder how long this high will last?

2. Work gets done. Im exercising every day. I eat. I sleep. But outside of those four activities my life is nothing. My friends think I am doing well because Im exercising. But thats all I do. From the outside it looks like I am living my best self but I am an empty shell. It doesnt take energy to do anything. Im just not thinking. My mind is blank. Im going through the motions.

Aside from that I dont leave my bed. I cannot honestly reply to you if you were to ask what do you do? I dont think. I plug in some music to drown out my own thoughts. Time passes. I eat and put on a mask around my family to look okay, because above my dysthymia is the intense anxiety of my family ever finding out. When we could still go out, I would bail on my friends or on work by calling in sick. I cant fall asleep until 3am so I cut. I think about what I would put in a suicide letter to my friends. I cry.

4. I dont give a fuck about work. Im making a suicide plan. But I cant enact it, because the place I want to throw myself off a cliff from is an entire state away.

Im researching how much ibuprofen you need to overdose. Whats the point of living. I wish Id never existed. I hate reality. I hate society. The world is a horrible place and the only way out is death. If I dont want to live, why am I staying here? 

Usually I am at about a 2, sometimes 3. 4 only happens very briefly (a few hours) at night when I cant sleep, but its very intense. I know I need help and I impulsively book a doctors appointment for the next day. But by the time the next day comes Im back at 2 or 3 and I dont think anything will be solved by talking to a doctor.

Ok so I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about 3 years ago. For the first year and a half my thyroid was so out of wack. A normal thyroid shouldnt be higher than 4 and mine was at 16! Anyways after being synthoroid and getting blood work every 3 months I was still way over the norm. Finally after way too many blood tests and med adjustments I finally got to a normal level. 

However before I even realized I had it I had started to gain a noticeable amount of weight. Wayyyy more than Im comfortable with. I lost about half of it but now its been over a year and no matter what I do I cant lose weight. 

I could starve myself for a month (not saying I actually do) and probably gain 20 pounds! Im so fucking frustrated and its really taking a toll on me physically and mentally.

Anyone know of anything that actually helps? My blood levels are normal and Im on 137mg of Synthoroid.

Still, my doctors have been very reluctant to prescribe allopurinol as a preventative measure since I don't suffer often enough. After a *lot* of pushing, however, I managed to persuade my doctor to write a ""just in case"" prescription of colchicine to have on hand should I ever need it.

Last time this happened he wrote me a prescription for 6 pills. I took 3, and it ended a month-long flareup in two days. So I was definitely a fan. This just-in-case script was for 60 pills. To just have on hand. (Only cost me $30 without even having a drug plan - so grateful to live in this country!)

Weird title but couldn't think how to pose the question really . 

I'm wondering if it's possible that cfs could be present but be mild enough that you wouldn't/couldn't notice until you've pushed too far and then are really sick. 

By this I mean in 2020 at the start I wouldn't of really noticed having cfs except for a few things before it all came to a head in late 2020. 

Except for things like while out on a walk with the Mrs kids and dog I got wiped out really quickly but kept going . My legs especially tired and ached.  I thought it was lack of exercise because I was sat on my ass for way too long. Anyway move forward I had set up my own home gym I had laid a new concrete fence carried it all on my own dug out on my own etc but found myself again real tired real easily. And constantly feeling like I had delayed onset muscle soreness. 

I started out in my gym and was doing ok for a month or two. Then in October it hit and I couldn't shake the fatigue and feeling unwell. 

Began to develop fibromyalgia type symptoms and neurological symptoms with it all too. I know I've told my story before here and on the fibro and bfs subreddits but I've only come to realise that it is possible something was present early on in 2020 . I wasn't diagnosed until 2021 after I started twitching I March and I had been having more and more symptoms and constant feeling of being ill the  started getting bad pem.  Neuro saw me said it was bfs that was causing twitching. 
Fibromyalgia for the sensory pain issues and possibly cfs . 

Move forward a few weeks/months and my doctors and pain consultant confirmed cfs fibromyalgia.  

Is there a possibility that my cfs had developed way before the peak but it was extremely mild. I don't even know if that's a thing but it's got me curious"

As it is quite a long read, iI'm not through yet, but it sounds very interesting. My first thought was to check what effect this sub's favorite medication - LDN and thiamine/benfotiamin - has on neuroglia. And actually i found one or the other study that shows how those compounds regulate inflammation in neuroglial cells.

What do you guys think about this?
I haven't tried LDN or benfotiamine yet, but for me this is a strong push to do it asap. Do you know any other compounds that could work on neuroglia?

This is the abstract:
*""In spite of decades of research, the pathobiology of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue 
Syndrome (ME/CFS) is still poorly understood. Several pathomechanisms have been identified - 
including immune abnormalities, inflammatory activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, endothelial 
dysfunction, muscular dysfunction, cardiovascular dysfunction, and dysfunction of the autonomous 
nervous system. Yet, it remains unclear how these pathways are related, which of them may be 
upstream or downstream, and which ones may be explanatory of the symptomatology of ME/CFS 
(and thus possibly targets for therapeutic interventions). A similar uncertainty is currently 
experienced by thousands of researchers who struggle to understand Postacute Sequelae of Covid 
(PASC, ""Long Covid""), a condition with many similarities to ME/CFS. 

In this paper, we present a theoretical strategy that may help clarify the causal chain of 
pathophysiological events in ME/CFS. We propose to focus on the common final histological
pathway of ME/CFS. I.e., we suggest to ask: Which cellular compartment may explain the 
pathological processes and clinical manifestations observed in ME/CFS? Any functional unit 
consistently identified through this search may then be a plausible candidate for further exploration. 
For this ""histological"" approach we have compiled a list of 22 undisputed clinical and 
pathophysiological features of ME/CFS that need to be plausibly and most directly explained by the 
dysfunctional cellular unit in question. For each feature we have searched the literature for 
pathophysiological explanations and analyzed if they may point to the same functional cellular unit.

Through this search we have identified the CNS neuroglia - microglia and astroglia - as the one 
functional unit in the human body which may best explain all and any of the clinical and pathological 
features, dysfunctions and observations described for ME/CFS. While this points to 
neuroinflammation as the central hub in ME/CFS, it also points to a novel understanding of the 
neuroimmune basis of ME/CFS. After all, the neuroglial cells are now understood as the functional 
matrix of the human brain connectome which operates beyond and above specific brain centers, 
receptor units or neurotransmitter systems and integrates innate immune functions with CNS 
regulatory functions pertaining to autonomous regulation, cellular metabolism and the stress 
response. 

Of note, this is not a unifying theory about the etiology, the triggers or the inception process of 
ME/CFS. This approach is focused solely on finding the final pathogenetic pathway(s) which may 
underlie the clinical manifestations of ME/CFS. It does not question existing theories about the 
inception of ME/CFS, be they based on autoimmunity, persistent infection, mitochondrial or metabolic 
failure or any other assumption.""*"

I am diagnosed with dysthymia, but sometimes I wonder if Im actually a bit bipolar. A couple times a year or so Ill find myself feeling like I suddenly have clarity on what I need to do to turn things around.

I was overflowing with ideas and started collecting materials and looking into business rentals. Then just as quickly as it came on I completely abandoned the idea and lost all interest in it. Another time it was an online training program for a new tech career. I came up with a study schedule, was totally confident this was what I wanted to do, and stuck with it for about a week before completely changing my mind.

So I guess my question is, does this happen to most people with dysthymia? Do most of you get brief periods where you think youve got it all figured out?

Hello! And good day to you

Been dealing with gout for ~ 2 years now. On 200 mg allo. 

Just had some anecdotes to share and see if anyone had similar experiences

Like most, the worst attacks were in the beginning while starting allopurinol; Utterly debilitating and unable to walk. The intensity of the attacks went down over time, I usually am symptom free now for months at a time with an occasional mini flare. 

Some odd things Ive noticed:
-

- sometimes if I have/had an attack it will start in 1 part of 1 of my feet. It will then migrate around my foot then eventually subside and move to my other foot

- sometimes it seems that other injuries or illnesses can trigger an attack. E.g. I got the flue and near the end of my flue symptoms a gout attack started, or on several occasions Id have a gout attack after getting another injury in my foot, (strained a muscle on the bottom of my foot when then led to an attack) 

All in all, Im lucky to have the life I have but damn, do flare ups suck.  Im in one now after the flue. Just wanted to share some thoughts.

I wish you all the best. And have a great day !"

Mom: I hated women like you who lost all their baby weight in six months.

Me: You know I literally poison myself each night and feel nauseated every day.

Mom: I know. I still would have hated you.

People comment on how skinny I am all the time. Im a white woman, so skinny, is thought to be complimentary. Because of the years I spent trying in vein to lose weight before Xyrem, I know how hard it is for most people. I started dieting at 14 and was on and off every diet known to man for the next 17 years. Then I went on Xyrem and lost 50 lbs. 

I was listening to an episode of Code Switch (NPR Podcast) recently on standards of beauty and femininity for Black women and Latinas, and they addressed how women who get cosmetic surgery to achieve these unrealistic beauty standards are shamed for cheating. Thats how I feel about Xyrem. I would never claim that the ways my body is policed, judged, and (de)valued compares to what women of color experience. At the same time, I do feel like there are people in my life who think Xyrem was the easy path to weight loss, or that I cheated. This is bullshit, but as much as I push back on it, people call it a silver lining of my disability. I am all about asset-based framing, but thinness isnt the type of asset being referred to by those advocating for asset-based lenses. 

Narcolepsy sucks and at this point, I accept it as part of who I am. That doesnt mean I wouldnt trade it all and reclaim those 50lbs if I could feel rested, energized, and awake on a regular basis.

Naps? Those never help. I either get really strange dreams or sleep paralysis, and once again wake up more tired. Also, if I take a nap and wake up, Ill just fall right back to sleep. This happens a couple times each nap.

Until the next flare, and the next and the next  (none treated medically because like lots of people, I thought I could deal with it on my own).... all fairly minor until another really painful flair two weeks ago that took me a week to recover from.  However, since April, I started to aim to drink 100 oz of water a day, started daily Vitamin C supplements, took tart cherry supplements when I had little attacks, started to eat less red meat, less carbs... , etc.

Finally bit the bullet and went to see a doctor. Surprise - I somehow lost 13 lbs and had dropped my Uric Acid to 9 just by the above changes.  But I was adamant - after reading this Subreddit, I did NOT want to be one of those people who suffered for years with the pain. I wanted to start a plan of action to get my Uric Acid levels to 6 and under.

This time he gave me a 3-day Prednosine scrip, and when I'm finished that, I'm supposed to take Indomethacin.  But I thought that was just for pain, and not for the actual flare?

Just started Allopurinol with the low dose of 100 mg with plans to slowly increase as we monitor my results. Anyway, wish me luck.  And to those of you who have been suffering from the pain, please go see a doc and get help!"

Does anyone have an intolerance to heat?

To be clear, I have looked this up multiple times and it seems that because I'm hypo and not hyper I should be more intolerant of the cold that the heat while hyper is the opposite way around.

I was diagnosed less than 2 weeks after birth, am 34 years old and it just feels like year after year it's getting worse. 

I take 300micrograms daily of thyroxine.

I absolutely can't stand the heat, well sometimes I don't even think that's the issue it's not the sweat, it just builds up and drips off my face constantly, I don't mind the heat so much but I just can't be out in it any more without dripping sweat everywhere it's humiliating and uncomfortable.

I love the cold, so much so that I don't normally feel cold or even close to it when others are complaining. There has been times when it's cold late at night or out camping and I can look down and see my hand slightly shiver and I know I need to warm up but I rarely feel cold myself.

I just want to know what if anything I can do to try and help my situation. Docs reckon that my levels are fine after every test but I don't personally understand any of the levels and what they mean. I aim to get my results from the doctor next time I get a test but I was just wondering if anyone else here has felt or had the same thing as me and maybe you've figured something out?

In an effort to get my doc to switch me to synthroid and cytomel since no other natural alternatives seem to be working effectively right now, he ordered new blood draws and a lipid panel for me. Been a while since I've done either.

The Lipid panel results also showed moderately elevated Cholesterol, Triglycerides, and non-HDL. My HDL is in-range but barely at 42. The Chole/HDL ratio is like 5.5 and normal is 5.0 or less I assume. Is there a connection between under-medicated hypo and higher than normal cholesterol?

Hej you all, I just wanted to share a thought with you that helped me quite a lot recently. It is not my own thought, it is sth Richard O'Connor expressed in his book *Undoing Depression* (which I strongly recommend btw). 

What he is saying is, that for him the differentiation between *major depression* and *dysthymia* is arbitrary and that depression is a continuum with different expressions of the same disease. In his view there is no such thing as a double depression (which is what you call it when alleged major depression and dysthymia align). People who are diagnosed with a double depression just have a depression that got worse, while people with a dysthymia have a depression which still lingers around/ is not completey healed. While I am not a psychologist in any way or can utter a professional opinion on that, I want to share why I think this view makes a difference for me.

1. Sometimes I felt insufficient for having dysthymia - as in: well, it ain't that bad if it's not major depression. You can still get out of bed. So: get yourself together and so on. Having a depression that is not healed somehow fits better into how I feel & it makes it more serious in a way.

2. It opens up way more source material to fight depression (as for some time I was trying to focus on finding a cure for dysthymia only).

3. Major depression can be healed. Thus: Dysthymia can be healed, too. Both are somewhat chronic diseases - but with the right system you might live nearly symptom-free.

Hey everyone, i made this post on the bipolar forum. I would really appreciate getting some thoughts from people here as well!!

Hi, I was hoping to get help figuring out whether i have some form of bipolar and/or whether i have something like chronic fatigue syndrome. In general, i have 3/4 good days a week, and 3/4 bad days a week. This has been very consistent.

During the good days, I feel good (but not ultra good, almost i would say 'normal' good). But i also feel this restlessness to keep doing things. I can't relax. And i can't really properly prioritize. I kind of just throw myself into reading psychology related stuff, as its my passion and i plan to study it soon. During these times, it's like my cognition is a lot better and ideas flow relatively easily in my mind. My energy is normal when i would otherwise feel fatigued. As said, i hyper-focus on things, and can only do 1 thing well rather than many things well. Contrary to my usual self-doubt, i feel confident about myself and the future. I feel lovable and competent when otherwise i would feel unlovable and incompetent.

During the bad days, i lose my ability to read for the most part. I get mentally fatigued very easily. I became self-critical and indulge every now and then in hopelessness. I start becoming cynical about loved ones. There's this chronic mental pain that i can minimize but can't eliminate no matter what i think or do. I can't find enjoyment in things that i would usually find enjoyment in. Following my passions and my purpose becomes overwhelming and exhausting. Even though i have a sense of the type of person i want to be and the life i want to lead, i just feel trapped by all of these symptoms.

The reason why i wonder whether this could be chronic fatigue syndrome is because i know that it's characterised by post-exertional malaise. Whereby if the person over-spends in terms of mental, emotional, or physical energy, then they become especially fatigued later on. They pay a significantly disproportional price. My down periods tend to follow me spending a lot of mental and/or emotional and/or physical energy. It's like there's this ceiling on my life. I can only make a limited amount of progress before I pay a significant price. Yet during this high periods, i feel this restlessness to keep doing things and i always inevitably crash. Relaxing for long periods of time is extremely difficult.

I'm thinking that i might have some form of ultra rapid cycling bipolar 2/cyclothymia. I'm going to discuss it with a psychologist and psychiatrist soon. Just wanted to get people's thoughts here beforehand. Any help would be much appreciated!"

hi, I was just diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia and I am now trying to take in the mountain of information that's been thrown at me and understand the barriers in the way to treatment. I am 25f and sleep 12-17 hrs almost every single day, so between that and working I basically have no room to have any sort of life. 

my sleep specialist told me most medications that could help are narcolepsy meds prescribed off-label and not typically approved by insurance for IH, but that he could likely get them to approve nuvigil if he put infrequent shift work in my chart. he said, however, that it would make my iud ineffective, which is not the end of the world for me but I have really appreciated not having to deal with a period or the litany of PMS symptoms attached to it for the last few years, and I definitely do not want to get pregnant at this time. he said Sunosi does not have these issues but is not covered by most insurance for IH at this time. Right now my ability to function is entirely dependent on taking 30-40mg adderall a day (dx'd ADHD) and drinking 2-3 energy drinks, which buys me the 8 hours I need to work before I come home and sleep until my next shift. I could increase my adderall dosage to 20mg twice a day but he said even the 15 I'm on now is pretty high and is not a long-term solution.

At this point I guess I'm just looking for personal experience and anecdotes from people who have tried these medications or have any insight into navigating insurance coverage/affordability issues for off-label usage. I checked goodrx and Sunosi is $688.11/mo at my cheapest local pharmacy, which is only $100 cheaper than my rent (which I split 50/50 with my boyfriend!) for a 2bd apartment (which is to say, it is not affordable for me). Is Nuvigil/armodafinil worth the big lifestyle change? Is it typically more effective than adderall? 

Before I had an IUD, my period was like one week out of each month where it was guaranteed my IH symptoms would be hell and I would sleep the vast majority of every day. I've read this is pretty common in women with IH. Are there any women here who are similar and have tried armodafinil who can give me like any input at all? I'm so overwhelmed by all of this I don't even know what to consider or where to start. If it's going to be just as effective as adderall I'm not sure it's worth such a big lifestyle change right now, but I would do just about anything if I could make some significant improvements in my IH symptoms.

I'm sorry for the long-winded, possibly intrusive post but this is the only place I could think to ask that might have some insight here. Thanks for your time if you've read all this!"

1. Sometimes I felt insufficient for having dysthymia - as in: well, it ain't that bad if it's not major depression. You can still get out of bed. So: get yourself together and so on. Having a depression that is not healed somehow fits better into how I feel & it makes it more serious in a way.

2. It opens up way more source material to fight depression (as for some time I was trying to focus on finding a cure for dysthymia only).

3. Major depression can be healed. Thus: Dysthymia can be healed, too. Both are somewhat chronic diseases - but with the right system you might live nearly symptom-free.

We are not doomed. Sometimes dysthymia feels like a livelong fate - it's not. That's what I take from this view."

Just turned 35 and got a flare gout since monday.  At first, I though it was from an injury in a sport event (I played volleyball tournaments twice in the week-end) but it turned out, my doc diagnose it as a gout crisis.  My question is, how you guys manage with alcohol and/or diet?  Do you just cut it all or a couples of beer with a steak on the week-end is okay?  I need to have some blood test in a couple of weeks to determine the course of the treatment but I'm kind of affraid tbh.

im in the process of getting a proper diagnosis, so im not 100% certain if i have narcolepsy, if it is something else, or if i am just tired. 

outside of school my main struggle is driving. it got to the point where i would always make sure to have water in my car within reaching distance to dump on myself to try to stay awake. 

as far as school, i struggled in undergrad staying awake, studying without napping, etc., but i wouldnt say i fell asleep in every single class. im in dental school now and i am dying in lecture. we have lecture most days from 8-12 and 1-5. i understand that 8hrs of straight lecture is draining for everyone but i feel like i am fighting for my life every single day in class to stay awake. i am more focused on staying awake than i am on what is being taught. when im not in lecture and am standing up for example during rotations i am still dozing off. my grades are suffering and im terrified that ill have to repeat my first year. 

i started 100mg modafinil about two weeks ago and at first saw such improvement that it made me emotional. before i started, i was up to about 5 naps/day with a full night of sleep which made it nearly impossible to get any productive studying done. even after starting the medication i catch myself dozing off in lecture, although not nearly as much as before. i also still have to come home after school and take a two hour nap and wake up very groggy. 

im hoping that i can get my sleep study done soon, but as of now any tips to stay awake in a mundane setting would be greatly appreciated!!!"

Does creatine cause flares or exacerbate urate crystal buildup?

>Based on scientific research, the relation between creatine and gout is fairly simple to explain. Creatine  as well as foods high in creatine  will overwhelm the body with purines  the primary cause of gout. As a result, the creatine supplementation will inevitably increase the levels of uric acid and the probability to develop gout. The same effects will target men with or without gout.

t5_2srfv,kknm08,I'm not even sure it's dysthymia,"[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","Can you actually thrive while having dysthymia?
I'm not even sure it's dysthymia. Like, my therapists said it is, but the more I look it up, the less I believe it. I thought it meant ""permanent low mood"", like light version of constant depression, hence the similarities, but google seems to describe it more like ocd thoughts.

Let me preface this with - I was never a happy child. Our family situation was messed up and I ended up never having unrealistic expectations for my future - never wanted to be an astronaut, or a firefighter, or a giraffe. I always assumed when I get older it'll figure itself out. But ever since I was little, I was just getting by, surviving from day to day, not even with a thought ""when I get 18, I'm getting out of here"", cause I'm just one of these people who think ""yeah, my life is not important, more important is getting my siblings out of this shit"". So I just tunnelled all my strength and resources into my siblings. And then I decided, yeah, okay, no point in living anymore, my job is done.

My siblings freaked out, of course. I ended up in a mental ward. It gave me hope, gave me strength, showed me I can do all the stubbornness I always lived with, but this time not for my siblings, but for myself. And all the time I thought ""it'll all sort itself out eventually, it's okay"".

It didn't. There's nothing like that in me. We realised, me and my therapists, that I'll need to create it. Create something that every child develops naturally. I don't even know where to start.

Apparently I actively forbid myself from having dreams (not sleep ones). From having a goal, a road in life. I have all the opportunities ahead of me, but I'm just sitting on the crossroad, having no clue what to do. No road seems interesting. Nothing does.

And so I'm ending up with the same thoughts in my mind. I've done my job. My siblings are safe and thriving. My life has literally no meaning left in it. I took it away when I was a kid and no one ever tried to return it to me, so it's not there. Nothing is interesting, everything is just to kill the passing time before I die. 

And that's a constant thing for me. It always has been. Sometimes depression flairs up - my new meds really helped with getting more control over it, but it's still happens. Sucks when it does. The ""why"" in my mind gets... intense. Cause I still have no answer.

Is it possible to thrive with dysthymia? Can you actually find any meaning in life, when you have to live with it constantly?"

I learned to live a pretty nomal life with dysthemia and no prescription at all, I believe what helped a lot was that i was always curios about spirituality/inner peace, always did some type of physical activity, currently i meditate 1hr daily and trail run at least 2x week (its my therapy), but its not always butterflies and sunshine, i occasionally get depressed and sensitive but its not a soul crushing depression or leads me to have suicidal thoughts or stay in my room 24/7, it normally appears out of nowhere and could last a whole day or sometimes just hours, i believe my teachings of spirituality and meditation help me a lot to get of that funk.

Anyways, recently i been more sensitive and somewhat depressed than the usual, so i decided to get a 2nd assessment, my appointment was today but i cancelled because something in my head convinced me i really dont need it as i occasionally get sad and it really is not bone crushing or have suicidal thoughts and worried that this new therapist will put me on some drugs which im trying to avoid, do most people seek help on their own when they reach rock bottom? or do their loved ones take them to see someone, how and why did you end up seeking help?"

It's a long story but I think I upset the Nurse when I thought my hallucinations were caused by the sleep disorder (he thought it was psychiatric, psychiatry thought it was sleep) and then afterwards tried to get them to fill out accommodations paperwork but they thought without the Narcolepsy diagnosis that they couldn't say I had a disability. It's frustrating because the Nurse before the test said that the antidepressants might interfered with the test but after I tested negative he didn't mention them.

Hello!

I have a few questions regarding ME/CFS. First off I was diagnosed with mild ME over 20 years ago. They weren't entirely sure what it was, but they found nothing else that was wrong with me. However during the following 12 years I slowly improved and got fairly well. Never got the same energy back, but could function pretty fine and barely had any pain.

I was told back then ME is chronic, so I wonder if it really could have been that since I got better?

For my next question I want to say first I hope I don't scare anyone from getting vaccinated. I took my second covid vaccine shot about 5 months ago. Within a few hours I got muscle/joint pain, low grade fewer, sore throat and fatigue. This is normal, but I haven't recovered yet months later. It's gotten better overall, but some days it's all back then gets a little better and then back again. I feel roughly the same I did 20 years ago except I'm not as fatigue and don't have trouble to keep myself awake. I got no information out of health care at all about it, but did many tests and there's no signs of anything being wrong. I'm not sure if it's ME coming back or not.

Anyone know if this is something that has happened to others with ME after taking covid vaccine and did they recover again?

My last question is related to this possible flare from the vaccine. The pain is usually triggered by doing things like walking, cooking or cleaning for example (some days it's always there). In addition to the pain the muscles feel very stiff. The stiffness is reduced by resting and comes back when doing things again. I don't remember feeling stiff before together with the muscle ache.

Is stiffness common with ME?

Hi! Last week I went for a blood test just to check up on everything. Before going, I KNEW they would find something wrong with me as Ive felt absolutely awful for about 2 or 3 years now in different weird ways. First of all Ive felt fatigued all the time to the point where Im used to it, joint pain everywhere in my body at times, mainly in my hands, elbows, knees, shoulders especially when working out (leading to me stopping as I was afraid of injuring my rotator cuff) and extremely bad headaches occasionally. The weirdest symptom I have though is that at least a few times a week, I get a feeling in my eyes and mouth where they feel dry asf along with tingly feelings across my skin which I cant really explain properly, along with an EXTREME burst of fatigue. My hands also feels cold to the touch when this happens, so strange lmao. Also during the summer I remember it always happening at the same time every day, around 6-7 oclock in the evening. The problem with all these symptoms are they arent severe enough to go to a hospital, but enough to know something isnt right.

Anyway, today I got my tests back and they were kinda what I suspected, nothing extremely dangerous from what I can tell but a few issues definitely. Firstly, they said I had a folic acid deficiency and anaemia, which my father also has and I was also told I had the same issue in my last blood test 3 years ago yet nothing was done so that wasnt surprising. Then my doc told me I had a Vitamin D deficiency, I think she said it was around 9 ng/ml, which may be bad idk but the worst thing of all, an extremely high number of TSH in my blood and possible hypothyroidism as a result pending further tests, the next in 6 weeks (which seems like a lot of time to leave me hanging but whatever lmao). I read up on hypothyroidism and while I do have the symptoms of it, it looks to be very rare in men and my doc said it may have just been a blip and that I shouldnt be concerned about it yet, and instead on the other two issues.

From what Ive mentioned of my symptoms, and my other two issues, do you think I should be concerned or not? Ive also experienced random hair loss the past few months which is a symptom too but that could just be mbp, then again Id have to be cursed to have that at 17 lol.

Anyway ty for reading this long ass post, any answers to my concerns are greatly appreciated!"

Should I take a second opinion?
Hi all, I am 31 years old male and recently did a general series of blood tests since I was about to leave to a remote place with poor access to medical facilities. My serum uric acid level in the test is 6.9 mg/dl. I don't have any pain like gout and I deduce this from reading posts in this community. However, I have had a slight bunion in my left foot since a couple of years. However, the pain from bunion went away once I started wearing a toe separator prescribed by an Orthopedic Physician. No pain since then. The pain comes if I don't wear the toe separator for at least a couple of days and walk around for quite some time. However, the pain only comes while walking and there is no swelling as such. I am able to bend my toe backwards. The bunion occured at a time when I was taking calcium supplements for another issue.

With the recent blood work when I went to my general physician, he asked me to take Febuxostat 40mg twice a day for 1 month, followed by once a day thereafter. This he said stating that my serum uric acid level is on the higher side. However, since the bloodwork says that the maximum value of serum uric acid is 7.0, I am confused if I should start the medication or take a second opinion. With your experience, what do you people suggest? I know that most of you might not be doctors, but I am sure that dealing with gout for long, you might have something to say.

Thanks!"

Dear CFS-community,

I have been diagnosed with ME, dysautonomia (POTS and OH/OI) and fibromyalgia about a year ago. I possibly will also be getting diagnosed with costchondritis soon. 

My doctor prescribed me LDN last year in March. Because Im very sensitive to about all kinds of meds he advised me to start with 0.12mg a day and after a week or two go to 0.25mg a day. I never got there because in the first week I experienced extreme insomnia, a weird fuzzy feeling in my head and the sense of false energy. Like when you do your things on a surge of adrenaline, but with a worse crash afterwards. That same week I ended up in and ambulance because my tachycardia went wild. It was very scary and a even a little traumatic. During that time I wasnt yet dianosed with POTS and didnt have my compression stockings, salt and water. I do now but it still goes wild every now and then. We already talked about meds for the POTS, but my doctor is hesitant about those. 

The months after that incident were awful, I was bedbound and couldnt eat. I went from moderate to very severe. That was from March to about August. Then I got a little better and at this moment I am mildly severe and housebound. 

Now my doctor asked me to give LDN another try because, in his words, its the best chance I have. He advised me again to start with 0.12mg and go to 0.25mg when I feel like Im ready. When Im on 0.25mg for a week we would have contact again. But I am very cautious and a little scared. 

What if that bad period was caused by LDN and what if it messes me up again? I never recovered to being moderate. Now that Im mildly severe I want to be very cautious to not get any worse. I am weaker now. I recently had oral thrush because my body and  immune system are exhausted. We did bloodwork, but except from high cortisol and my B12 being just a little on the low side, everything was fine. 

I dont use any meds right now, only the birth control pill. Im planning to quit that though. Ive tried carnitine before, it made me feel extremely fatigued on top of the regular fatigue. It felt like the last drop of life energy was squeezed out of me. So we quit that after three days. 

ANYWAY, I just dont know what to do and I would very much appreciate any advice that you can give me. Should I maybe try CBD-oil first instead of LDN? Ive heard some people do experience a temporarily exacerbation of their tachycardia but other than that it seems less of a risk than LDN. Or is my fear of LDN just irrational? Please, help me out. 

English is not my native language so I apologise in advance if my use of words seems funny."

I got so used to it that I figured everyone felt the same way. I figured everyone fell asleep, all the time, unable to *function* without sleep, and while driving every single night.  I know it probably sounds ridiculous, but I thought it was normal. 

The only reason it even came up recently was because of my toddler. 9 months. I nod off playing with him on the floor, and it was seriously pissing off my wife and causing me and her both anxiety and stress, aside from my new job and a recent move which has all been very stressful also.

Please help me. DM me or reply on this thread.

I dont trust the mrna vaccines, not bc I think that mrna will modify my dna or anything , but bc of what people say about it being an inexact amount of replication of the spike protein, not a finite dose... like just a direction to make it which could make too much.   Whereas protein subunit vaccines are giving you a specific, smaller dose of the spike proteins , I believe ? Correct me if I'm wrong.  And also more comfortable with novavax on paper bc it has technology used in vaccines that I've taken before, like the hep b vaccine.  I dont have any huge conspiracy theories about the vaccines and I think they're fine for most healthy people but the fear seems reasonable given how sick I am, and how I know of about 50 percent of the people with *severe* ME that I know personally, ceashing for some long time after.  (I'm not trying to spread fearmongering, and if this kind of discussion isnt allowed here, mods lmk.   For the record I also know covid is very terrible and I take tons of precautions like wearing n100s, not going inside any stores , and caregivers same precautions plus they're triple vaxxed.  So I'm not like a wingnuts I'm just trying to ask a question based on specific sensitivity, not spreading antivax ideas).

Additional concerns is that people I know with the same illnesses as me seem especially sensitive and get sicker after pfizer and moderna. 

However I cant risk getting covid either, long covid is pretty nasty.  I've been waiting for novavax , and my mast cell activation syndrome doctor didnt say it was bad but thought that the reactions with Pfizer are more well known, she didnt say they didnt exist but that they are manageable with medications and that we know less about novavax bc they aren't really putting a lot of shots in people's arms. 

I'm still leaning toward novavax like 95 percent but there's a part of me wondering if shes right.  I have to at least try vaccination to be eligible for other things like monoclonal antibodies she can get me. Novavax looks good on paper but idk if the trials used people with my specific illnesses.  That's a problem for pfizer trials too but at least tons of people like me have gotten Pfizer so clinicians and peers have seen what happened to them so far.

So what do you think?  Is this a devil we know versus devil we dont know situation, or is novavax just an angel we dont know,  and so much more likely to be better than Pfizer based on its structure ?

Also, this is a long shot bc the sub is small, but for people that have had novavax so far, have any of them had diseases like mcas or me/cfs, or pots?  How have the reactions been in healthy people in general?  Healthy people take the vaccines better but I still know of people who are healthy who crash for a few days in a way that's not like any normal vaccine after Pfizer/Pfizer/moderns moderna.

Hi all,

So appreciative of this community existing; this is going to be a long post so bare with me and thank you in advance.



About 18 months ago, I was prescribed Fenofibrate due to extremely high triglyceride levels that have been a lifelong issue. 

About 6 months after that prescription of daily fenofibrate, I experienced my first gout attack on vacation. 

The pain was 9 out of 10, and at first I had no idea it was gout. I visited the ER thinking it was a broken toe; X-rays confirmed it wasnt, and after given some steroids for the swelling and painkillers, I was sent on my way. 

A few days later I went to urgent care and they estimated it was gout and I ended up going to my GP to seek treatment. 

My GP was great at describing everything and did the following:
- recommended I go on a gout diet
- recommended I stopped drinking (I was having about 4-6 glasses of wine a week - thanks pandemic!)
- prescribed a daily dose of 100mg Allopurinol
- prescribed Colchicine for acute flare ups
- prescribed Indomethacine for acute flare ups

I did everything I was told, and for 8 months I was mostly fine, with two exceptions:
1. The once a month Id have a single drink, I would turn flush. Possibly from liver function side effects from Fenofibrate?
2. My toe never was 100% normal, but there was no pain and it was 95% normal in appearance. 


Ok, all caught up?


2 months ago, I had a flare up of gout. Nothing major, but some toe pain in the 3/10 range. It passed after a few days. Not sure of the trigger event. 


This week however, I had a gout attack in my elbow and the pain has been excruciating. Easily 9/10 pain levels. 

The two possible triggers are:
1. Ive been under a lot of recent stress 
2. I had 2 beers in 3 days

My question, is it possible my gout is being caused by Fenofibrate?

One of the side effects of Fenofibrate is decreased kidney functions - specifically the increase of serum creatinine levels. [here](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/815413)

\*WARNING LONG POST\*

Hey everyone,

I am suffering from my first Gout flare-up. I would like to share what is happening and get some advice, hear feedback etc.

I'm 31 years old, lean muscular body, athletic, healthy mostly plant-based diet, barely drink. Not always been like this though.

I have suffered from psoriasis and IBS (accompanied with Insomnia) since I've been young, but both have been under control for a while. When I was a teenager and early 20s I was very unhealthy. Exessive alcohol, red meat, and lots of processed carbs. I started getting really sick, like really bad IBS. As well as getting ill I would also feel sick/bloated after food. My psoriasis was also horrible, with thick plaques on my head and on parts of my body and legs. I stopped eating meat about 9 years ago and through trial and error noticed that gluten was making me feel sick after eating. After cutting these out, my IBS started getting better and would only have occasional flare-ups. I still drank too much and that had an impact on my psoriasis which remained persistent. Not sleeping would give me trouble and so I would drink to sleep, an unhealthy shitty cycle.

About 6 years ago I cut sugar out my diet pretty much, weaned myself onto dark dark chocolate (which I now love), drank less and started using topical/oral CBD. My psoriasis started clearing up.

Then for the last 4 years, I really switched my life around. I started taking various longevity supplements, eating pretty much keto (pescatarian), started sporting 7 days a week. I went from being overweight/fat (85kg+) to 66kg muscular/lean. I cut alcohol down to a bare minimum. Every few weeks I may have a few cocktails or a few more with the occasional party, and many times months with no drinking.  My psoriasis disappeared and IBS was virtually non-existent (spare from when I stupidly couldn't resist a few bits from my GFs delicious-looking pizza). I would like to add that I have also cooked almost every day for the past few years, healthy delicious fresh food.

About a year ago I started getting joint pain after having a fairly serious combat sports injury in my hip, which resulted in my knees being damaged too.  I went and received stem cell treatment in September. This worked and my injury was pretty much healed but I was very aware that my joints in general were super stuff and clicked (way more than the average person).

Then in October, my house burned down in a horrible accident whilst I was away on holiday. I spent November and December living in a hotel room, before staying at a friend's place for Xmas and new year, before flying to Mexico (where I am currently). During the period in the Hotel, my diet slipped slightly, I was having to eat more processed foods (room service) but nothing crazy unhealthy.

Over the holiday period, I drank way more than I usually would. Xmas eve, day n boxing day. Nye, day and the day after. A lot for me but not a lot compared to most people I know. My diet was less healthy than usual and I had more sugar than my usual (almost zero) but still hardly any in the grand scheme of things. I then flew to Mexico a week ago and had 3 nights where I had alcoholic drinks and a fair amount of seafood.

Then 3 days ago after cycling 20km I went to go get a glass of water and suddenly felt immense pain in my foot. I immediately thought I had broken my foot. My toe/foot was swollen at the side and shiny red. I don't really like visiting hospitals or doctors after being given so much bad advice/medicine previously, so I thought I would wait and see if it was as bad the next day. That night I thought I was dying, which sounds so stupid as it was just a foot! I hobbled to the hospital yesterday and they did an x-ray and blood test. Lo and behold my uric acid level was 8.0 and my inflammatory markers were way high.

They told me I had gout and gave me some prescriptions and a bunch of painkillers. I've lived to deal with chronic pain (without painkillers) for years with my IBS and the injury I mentioned previously however this is a whole new level. Last night I caved and took a lot of painkillers, which only slightly helped.

I am currently sitting here in agony after drinking water with lemon all day (many litres) needing to hobble to the toilet constantly. To all those who have been suffering from this before, wow, fair play. It is horrible.

All the videos/advice online tells me to follow a certain diet (similar to how I eat already) and drink little alcohol (the moderate amount is WAY more than I drink!). I assume that the 2 months of being slightly less healthy have caused this, but it seems pretty crazy that it could cause something that quick and when in comparison to many people it's still been a healthy two months. Going by what I read online, my diet lately just doesn't seem unhealthy compared to what people eat on average, especially those who often suffer from Gout

I wonder if anyone else has Gout who has experienced something similar?

Anybody live a healthy lifestyle and is a similar age but suffer from inflammation-induced Gout?

I read online those with Psoriasis can have higher chances (3 to 5x) more of developing it even if healthy. If so what can you do? I would like to add that I had a TINY patch of Psoriasis appearing after being stressed from the fire, but still a minor flare-up.

I also wondered how effective tart cherry supplements are? I already have been taking MSM and other recommend joint supplements for years.

Does anyone know about the likelihood of it returning and also developing into Psoriatic arthritis (my biggest fear)?

Is it possible to have a one off attack?

Sorry for the ridiculously long message and thanks in advance to anyone who can help. <3

Hi
I was curious if anyone else here has tried an anti-inflammatory diet for managing gout. I got my first attack in February and was following the advice of avoiding high purine foods. I found something on YouTube which talked about inflammation being the main culprit behind gout flare ups. The guy on that video was suggesting a keto diet which I haven't done. I've mostly tried to cut out a lot of extra carbs and really limit my alcohol intake. I've been taking turmeric and lots of ginger, as well. It seems to have worked, until a couple days ago I started to feel a flare up after a couple days of drinking more beer. 

I also got some gout tea from my mom who found it in Chinatown. It seems to work well but isn't cheap. It's sold online as Pure Chinese Herbal Formula, Special Gout Tea.

Numb, **angry**, *tired*, alone, **worthless**... Cold.

&#x200B;

\^ My life in a nutshell.

&#x200B;

The only person who would be effected if i were to disappear is my wife. My mum would be devastated, step dad would mourn for a while... My work mates would move on in the blink of an eye. The navy doesn't need me. I'm fresh out of training and i know nothing. I'm literally the last person in my department that will be called in if there's a job on. 

At the end of the day I am nothing more than brief thought in the back of every ones mind. just another person. just a number.

There is only 3 people i can think of that would be truly effected if i disappeared (not dead, **just gone**... hiding if you will).

&#x200B;

Most of the time i feel physically numb. like my sense of touch has been dialled down to 75% and ability to react reduced to 10%

The only feelings that i can truly recognise in myself (outside of the brief bursts of joy) are anger, resentment, frustration, disgust at the world around me and self hate.

&#x200B;

My ability to react to trauma and significant events just doesn't exist. just ""meh, it's done... lets go.""

7 or so years ago when my dad died i cried for around 10 minutes then back to being numb. i mourned for a week or so in a subtle way then life just went on. Pets die and it's over in a few minutes. It's not that i don't care... I do care... I just don't see the point in showing it.

&#x200B;

I feel bad for the ones who do care about me and the fact that i don't talk to them. I don't talk to anyone unless i have to. I feel ashamed and that i don't talk to anyone. i rarely talk to my parents, I want to talk to my Grandma that i haven't seen or spoken to in over a year knowing that she would love to hear from me instead of hearing about me... I just cant do it. 

I'll get the motivation but then my mind says whats the point...

I don't know why.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I was playing World of Warships: During matches i was full of energy, laughing and having a blast but then the match would end and before the next round starts I would struggle to fight back tears... Why? I don't have the slightest clue.

Then the match starts, the distraction continues and i'm fine. I dissolve myself into virtual worlds because it keeps me out of my own reality even though it's destroying relationships and my sanity.

Every time i come out of my escape, the real world slowly becomes more and more unbearable.

My thoughts become darker and darker and my breaking point draws nearer and nearer as i feel the pent up rage and frustration starting to boil over.

I'm not suicidal but i fear that one day i will be.

I have been thinking about how call people with CFS have a high prevalence of hypermobility is ability issues.

I was listening to the experts talk and I started to wonder if perhaps the reason I have long covid and my friend don't it's because my vascular system is more stretchy and hyper mobile than other peoples... I've known for a long time from having EDS having EDS that my is that my vascular system can be kind of stretchy and open...  So now I am wondering if perhaps the little microclottes got lodged in my little capillaries because they are just stretcher and allow them to enter.. Once those little Clot's gets stuck it creates a cascade of inflammation that is perpetuated.

I have also been thinking about the cranial servical instability issue and this issue and I wonder if that might compound compound a problem of blood flow... But might not necessarily be the main trigger.

 Right now it is not established that people with hypermobility issues have higher rates of long covid but I suspect it From what I read On the long covid forum... It is established in CFS that that the rates are high.

I had my first gout flare-up when I was around 40. The previous night I had gone out for a burger and beer and the next day, I swore I must have somehow broken my toe...the pain was...you know. 

Fast forward to today. It took me around 8 years to finally get on Allipuranol and while the flare-ups decreased in frequency it took me increasing my dosage to 300mg before they really subsided. 

I've learned a lot about my triggers and have read far too much than I ever thought I would about a disease. In short while I haven't had a beer in probably 10 years, I still occasionally have a glass of wine...and now maybe a scotch or whisky.

I decided to really change my life too as I'm 50+ now and I still have a child in elementary school. Over the past 2 years, I was diagnosed with a fatty liver and that was the last straw. Since that time I've eliminated saturated fats, cholesterol, and I've tried to decrease all added sugars.

I've dropped 50 lbs and gone from 220 lbs to 170lbs. I've also gone to a 95% plant-based diet. I occasionally have salmon but otherwise, I only eat plant-based foods. 

My high blood pressure, snoring, elevated A1C (liver enzymes), high heart rate, and tophi precursors on my feet, ...all of it, are gone. My uric acid fluctuates between 3.9 and 6.4 (after halving my Allipuranol dosage down to 150 mg). Fearful of having my gout recure, I've decided to stay on the Allipuranol for now but I'm still hopeful that I can indeed get off of it someday.

All that said, I'm running again, I'm backpacking, and greatly enjoying life again.

I'm curious to know if anybody has beaten their gout demons and been able to get off the meds...and if so how? Have you made any similar changes and how has it affected your gout?

I'm hopeful but still not sure where this journey leads."

t5_2s0tv,sgvy38,After reading around a bit on the internet I suspected that I might either be burned out or depressed so I went to see a doctor again.,"[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","Please help me interpret my lab results
Hello! 

This is going to be a quite long post but I think it might help if I include some background information.

I am a 29 year old male who have been feeling far from good in the past 4 years. I am experiencing many of the common symptoms of hypothyroidism such as: fatigue, increased sensitivity to cold, high systolic blood pressure (120/77 mmHg), pain in joints, thinning hair (could be just genetic), slowed heart rate , depression, impaired memory and brain fog. 

I always thought it was due to a lot of stress since I have been studying at university for a long time, so I never went to get checked up. After graduating I felt like things had gotten quite a bit worse in the past months and I decided to see a doctor. They thought it was just stress at first but decided to take a blood test to be on the safe side and it turned out that I had celiac disease. So I began following a strict gluten free diet and one year after I had a follow up check with gastroscopy, blood tests etc and everything looked well. Strangely enough I didn't actually feel any better despite this, all the same symptoms remained. 

After reading around a bit on the internet I suspected that I might either be burned out or depressed so I went to see a doctor again. I was sent to a psychologist who quite quickly determined that I was not depressed, they once again thought it was due to stress so they put me on a stress management program. I started meditating 30 mins per day and did a lot of other activities, like focused breathing a few times during the day. I felt like I got a little better but there was not really that much of a difference. After 3 months the psychologist was surprised that there was not really any improvement. I started feeling like it was a waste of time so I stopped going. Worth noting is that I usually do not actually feel stressed at all, I am a quite relaxed person and I always thought it was strange that everyone claimed that it was stress that was making me feel bad.

Fast forward six months and I started a new job in another country. In this country they have a mandatory health check up once a year and one of the things they do is to thyroid ultrasound. The doctor found scarring on the thyroid gland and thought that I might have hyperthyroidism. They took blood tests to confirm this but my levels were within the regular range: TSH: 2.9, fT4:1.32 . I saw some articles that argued that the TSH levels vary quite a bit during the day and I took my test around lunch time. So asked them to take another blood test early in the morning (8:30) but the results were the same. The final verdict I got was: 

""Suspicious findings of diffuse thyroid disease (scars of past inflammation) are observed. Please follow up in 1 year.

Diffuse thyroid disease is suspected of inflammation throughout the thyroid, not in any particular part of the thyroid gland. Thyroid function test (blood test, hormone level test) is normal. Please observe the progress of the follow-up medical checkup to see if the inflammation is progressing further.""

I was taken aback by these results, the symptoms fit so perfectly to how I was feeling so I really thought that this might be the explanation I had been searching for. Another result I got from the check up was as earlier mentioned that I have elevated blood pressure (120/77 mmHg) and they said that I also have arteriosclerosis, i.e. that my blood vessels are hard for my age. This was quite a surprise to me. I live a quite healthy lifestyle, I go out running 3 times a week, usually go climbing twice a week, am generally fit and borderline to underweight. I eat mostly vegetarian food and have never had any issues with my weight. A strange thing is that two months prior to this health check up I had to take another smaller check up and at that time my blood pressure was so low that I fainted when they took some blood samples   


Two other results that stood out from the test was the iron level in my blood, which was found to be 183 ug/DL (normal range 65-157), and UIBC which was 138ug/DL (normal range 191-269) . I did however not get any comments about this so I am not really sure what to think about it.  

I asked one of the doctors some follow up questions about thyroid disease and they admitted that it is a very rare disease here in this country and thus they are not that familiar with it. I therefore wonder what you guys think about these results? Is it clear that it is not hypothyroidism? I would really appreciate an answer even if it is just a guess!  


Many thanks in advance!"

So, let's start this off with me; I'm 14 years old. I've basically been depressed since... I don't even remember the last time I wasn't. Maybe 11 years old?

Anyway, I've never been really certain about what the hell was wrong with me. I was just down and hopeless and profoundly empty *all the time.* I didn't get real pleasure out of anything, even hobbies that I've always enjoyed. I would get a brief spark of motivation and write something for at most an hour but then it would be gone and I wouldn't write or read anything for weeks.

I don't have motivation for anything, ever. My self-esteem is basically six feet under. I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore, but they were omnipresent for a good few years (Resulting in an attempt about 9 months ago).

I don't feel things deeply anymore. Sometimes it seems like my emotions are buried in the middle of my chest inside a bees hive, and when I get a flicker of *anything* it just gets buried under the empty buzzing.

I've been diagnosed with Situational Anxiety Disorder since I was 12, but I have yet to get any diagnosis of depression (Although I'm in therapy right now).

I've only discovered what dysthymia is recently, and I'm pretty sure that it's what I have. Am I too young to feel like this? I don't really like to self-diagnose, but if I keep living without any idea of what's wrong with me, I might go mad, haha.

If I do end up diagnosed, I definitely want to go on medication. I exercise regularly, and I eat healthy enough, but nothing ever stops the blank feeling in my head or the knowledge that so much life and emotion are passing me by and there's nothing that I'm doing about it.

Any thoughts? Advice? Am I too young for dysthymia, or lucky to realize it this early? I feel like a stupid teenager pretending to have depression to seem edgy. I really just want to know if I'm alone.

Edit: So, it's been eight months since I made this post, and a lot has happened since then. My therapist told me I probably had dysthymia but kept my diagnosis as MDD to make it easier for me to get medication from a doctor since MDD is better understood. I started antidepressants about five months ago. I've been writing a lot more (nearly 25,000 words in November, go me!) and I actually had two weeks where I fell out of the diagnostic criteria for MDD recently. I've been doing really well. Things are good. Thank you all for being so concerned and for helping me when I needed it. I'm happy to update you guys now with something new. <3"

Hi all. I (22) went to see a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. After explaining symptoms + answering some questions, the doctor said that I have dysthymia and very mild OCD. I was happy when they said that because it's as though I finally have a legitimate reason as to why I'm feeling, thinking, and behaving the way I do all these years.

The thing is...I'm not exactly sure if I believe what the psychiatrist said is accurate. Or I might be gaslighting myself.

Here's why:
1. For the past weeks, I feel ""normal"". Ever since I took a break from university (a major stressor), I have been feeling more relieved and much happier. I still cry a lot (and very hard) at times but I also laugh out loud a lot. I feel like what I've felt for the past few years--normal. But I'm not sure cos I had a total of three breakdowns because of school during the past 4 years. Lots of stress and crying. But once the holidays are here, I feel so much better. 

2. Doctor didn't give a written confirmation (i.e. note or report) confirming my diagnosis so it doesn't feel real. They just told me verbally. Is this normal for a psychiatric evaluation and/or diagnosis? Or what the doc said isn't a diagnosis but kind of like a pre-diagnosis? Because the doctor also said depression is like a spectrum and my condition is fluid.

3. Not sure if my ""normal"" mood is already a part of depression or just...normal. 

4. Never heard of someone diagnosed with /very mild/ OCD. 

Sorry if this sounds ridiculous. But this diagnosis has been bothering me for the whole day and it's making anxious. Just had a little cry before deciding to ask for advice here. If it matters, the next appointment I have with doc is next month, before my first therapy session.

What should I do? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you."

Luckily my husband has earned enough for us to cope on just his wage. But he mentioned recently that I might have to look for a job soon because of rising costs of living. He's been so supportive and up until saying this he has never pushed me on getting a new job since leaving.

The thing is I honestly don't know if I'm well enough to have a job. In terms of ME, I'm probably mild/moderate but I also haven't done anything much for over a year. I'm able to get up and shower and dress myself almost every day, and I also do the weekly shop. Some days I'm down for the count and sleep most of the day even when I can't see what caused the PEM. 

I'll only be able to do part time work (max. 3 days) but even that seems too much. Plus because of past work experience the only thing I can really do is likely admin/office duties, which absolutely drain me. 

I really don't know what to do. I'm not severe enough to get any funding (believe me, I've tried) but somehow we're going to have to get extra money.

Anyone have any advice or been a similar situation so can sympathise?

TL;DR I'll need to return to work soon after over a year out and I don't know if I'll ever really be able to do it."

Hello! I'm new to this sub! I've suspected for several months that I have hypothyroidism, and I've seen my symptoms come together and get worse over the past three years. I have an appointment next Wednesday, and I'd like to be frank with my doctor. I have my list of symptoms that have worsened, proof that they have worsened, etc.

What is the best way to encourage my doctor to specifically look into the hypothyroidism? I'm a little concerned about my concerns being brushed off and ignored, but I've watched my body fall apart over the last year and no amount of changes in diet, activity, etc., has made even the slightest difference. I have the evidence, but I'm scared of being ignored.

I do not have a *known* family history of thyroid-related issues in my family, but my mother's side has had reported symptoms that I think are thyroid related. On my dad's side, there's a variety of disorders and illnesses that are reported and diagnosed, but none specifically thyroid related.

Just nervous. Maybe I'm mostly posting here because I'm afraid. I'm so convinced that there's something wrong with my thyroid, but what if it's something else? What if I'm just throwing myself for a loop? Anyway, any sort or direction, encouragement, or advice would be helpful."

Hi, I had a strange incident that seems to have really set off my depression the last few days. First off let me preface by saying many moons ago when I was young I dreamed of being a writer, both fiction and non-fiction. My dream was to put ideas and stories out there and have them affect people for good or bad and have them discuss them. Needless to say that didn't happen.

The closest people like me can get to that is of course the Internet, but that's tends to not go well. This last weekend I started commenting on the board of a pretty famous biologist. One of the comments I made was an innocuous post defending a celebrity against what I thought was people unfairly maligning some of her academic accomplishments. There was some kind of snarky pushback including by the biologist, and it sent me into a depression. Even a comment I made trying to be conciliatory and explain myself never made it through moderation.

I know I am guilty of not following my own dictum. I always say people post on the Internet not to hear from other people from themselves, and that certainly applies to me. I am also naturally horribly over sensitive, things other people wouldn't think twice about bother me for days. Plus I am transitioning between anti-depressants right now with all that goes with it. 

I think like a lot of dysthymics I am lonely though. I have ideas in my head that I would like to share, and the Internet is my only recourse right now. Sooner or later the toxicity of the Internet always smacks me back down though. 

How is it for other people? On balance do you find the Internet a place where you have found others you can relate to, or has it iften set off bouts of depression?"

New member, Looking for some advice here.  (Sorry for the long post, half of it is me trying to comfort myself). 

I am 42 yr old healthy male. I used to workout 4 times a week weight lifting and cardio, seriously eating healthy and my weight is in the right bmi. 

Few months ago did a full health test. My hba1c, blood pressure, cholesterol heart everything came normal, but uric acid, blood urea etc came high. Uric acid was close to 7. I was on a keto diet at time and peeing a lot so doc told it could be dehydration. Egfr was 67. So a month later I did another test and egfr was in the 80s. But they didnt do the uric acid. Anyways doc told nothing to worry. 


Fast forward two weeks ago, everyone at home got covid, starting with kids. I also got it but it was pretty mild - with just a dry cough and loss of smell.  10 days post symptoms, on the 11th day I was sleeping in the couch. Woke up after an hour and I had a small pain in my right ankle like a sprain. It pains when I twist my ankle. I thought I sprained my leg whilst in the sleep. Next day there was some swelling around the ankle - walking was a bit painful like I was limping. The day after I had some strong pain - then I took an ibuprofen and the pain became less also the swelling got better as well, but still when I twist the ankle it pains and whilst walking. So I called nhs and my  gp rang back. She told me that some people get joint pain after covid and she also told me could it be gout? Then I told her about the uric acid and she asked me to come in after a week for a full kidney test. I also have foamy urine occasionally, when I dont drink enough water.

Gp told me to keep taking ibuprofen and rest. Yesterday worked in the bed, didnt walk around much. Today 3rd day, I woke up and the pain has subsided significantly, I mean whilst twisting the ankle. All this time I was able to walk but limping and there was no pain when I give weight on the leg. Also I heard alcohol and red meat makes gout worse, so last night I ate some pork sausages and had two 50 ml cognac to see if its flares up, but it didnt. 


Ive been reading a lot about gout and the symptoms are confusing. What makes me even pissed is me eating very healthy and working out regularly maintaining healthy weight - I feel so sad. Everything was for nothing !

Any advice please? I am not overly stressed. If its gout it is, I cant do anything. What I want to know is can I still do weight lifting? I love my squats and deadlifts and kickboxing. Advice please."

I'm aware that even with omicron, and waning efficacy against transmission, covid vaccines protect against hospitalization and death.  

But the question of if they protect against long covid is more important to me, bc I know that chronic illness can be worse than death.  

Theres still not enough study on this topic, and I think that omicron further complicates things, but I tried to look at a few of the articles out there. 

[This is a review article from Nature, one of the most high impact scientific journals,](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03495-2) on the topic.  Its thorough, and from reputable source.  I have a subscription and dont know if their covid content is paywalled,  so if you cant get past a paywall for this link,  tell me, and I will either copy and paste it or download and repost a pdf of it. 

The gist of the article in question is that (before omicron,  when vaccines really did prevent transmission a decent amount), the vaccines lowered risk of getting covid and in turn absolute risk of long covid, but it doednt seem to actually lower the risk of getting long haul symptoms once you have a breakthrough infection.  But the article is worth reading in full bc there are more nuances than that.  

[Long covid risk no lower with breakthrough infection](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/long-covid-risk-no-lower-with-breakthrough-infection-covid-19-survival-improves-2021-11-24/) --Reuters.

I've also seen some studies saying that the shots help some with long covid risk.  But especially since delta, I've seen no studies or articles saying that vaccines protect *dramatically* against long covid.   

I'm not trying to discourage vaccination.   If you dont want to die from covid it's a good idea to get vaccinated. 

I do think the risks from covid and long covid have generally been worse than vaccine risks, but it's hard to compare these when we dont have vaccines necessarily tested with me/cfs or mcas populations that are severely reactive, and again, we dont know how effectively vaccines are against long haul symptoms.  

I guess where that leaves people concerned about long haul symptoms is to try and use excellent PPE, not go to appointments (sigh, given my health needs in general this is not a great time for this), and to look at addressing any underlying immune abnormalities. 

I wish we'd spent as much time and energy as a country developing antiviral therapy or treatments for long covid as we had with vaccines.  
Given how the few therapies of that sort are extremely rationed and not produced in high quantities right now, do any of you think an immunologist that knows about immune deficiencies could get one on a list or recommendation to receive treatments that are rationed for covid ?  Besides the Pfizer pill, there are preventative shots that aren't vaccines but rather some type of antibody cocktail for people with immune issues for whom the vaccine is either not helpful enough or not tolerated. 

And the good news is that the US seems to have invested a lot in longcovid research, but I'm just hopeful it ends up accounted for and not all on psychological studies or something. [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00586-y)

Just wanted to share (mostly for my followers) that as an experiment I am trying a new approach in my recovery journey.

Many of you will know that I have greatly benefited from high dose thiamine as described in [my post of a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/nvsg6s/about_high_dose_thiamine/). My general view on supplements and more info on my benefits from thiamine I shared here in [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/pvrhdl/supplements_as_a_fix_for_cfs_b1_b12_as_wonder/) (TLDR as regards these links: Thiamine and other basic supplements helped me go back to mild CFS from being couchbound/bedbound with severe POTS and moderate CFS, but haven't fully cured my CFS.)

My remission has stalled over the last months and I have become somewhat frustrated that I am still experiencing lack of energy. 

Also, as I have got physically better (no more PEM for example and restful sleep nearly everyday) I have become more symptomatic emotionally/mentally. I experience a lot more anxiety than when I was more incapacitated with CFS. 

I have got reason to believe that my very own case of ME/CFS (plus the anxiety) has a lot to do with ACE (adverse childhood events) and trauma unknowingly carried with me from my childhood days.

I was well and fine during adolescence (except for panic attacks which occasionally occured during my teenage years) and suddenly developed ME/CFS after a viral infection (with the flu) nearly a decade ago. 

I was diagnosed with ME/CFS only many years later. 

Until maybe 2 years ago, I thought that my anxiety and panic (stemming from adverse childhood events) were totally unrelated to how I was feeling physically, as I had had my panic attacks and anxiety for years with no physical limitations at all. And also because I didn't feel any notable anxiety anymore during my ME/CFS years.

When I discovered the thiamine theory I was extremely hopeful that this was gonna cure me. And it did get me out of bed. It allowed me to go back to work and take part in life again. 

But the lack of real energy (like before I got sick) remains.

I am grateful that I don't ache anymore, that PEM (with the sore throats and all) is gone. That I can sleep again.

But honestly, I really do want to recover to the extent where I can run and hike and do exercise again.

And I want to get rid of the anxiety hovering over my head. 

I have looked a lot into the theory that adverse childhood events can cause the nervous system to go into overdrive, which - if it carries on for years - can cause severe nervous exhaustion and if this could be my ME/CFS. I have come to the conclusion that in my case, it is very likely that that is the case.

(I am not saying that this is what ME/CFS in general is. But I believe it to be true in my case. And I was diagnosed with ME/CFS by an expert neurologist on CFS.)

Lately I have been looking into what can be done to remedy such nervous exhaustion possibly stemming from trauma (adverse childhood events) and it all leads to the same answer: get grounded in your body again.

And here is where my experiment shall start. I will try for the next few months to entirely focus on grounding myself in my body again. 

Now what does this mean? I don't fully know yet. It's an experiment. It will consist of things like: only eating what my body appreciates and likes and craves. Not eating anything ""just because it's healthy"".

It will entail actively and consciously enjoying sitting in the sun and feeling the warmth on my skin.

Out of a hunch I bought a door frame bar the other day and installed it. Just because I had the feeling in my body that I would enjoy holding on to one and let myself hang like that and swing like a swing. Yeah, like a monkey! And it made me whoop! I'm doing this now whenever I feel like it. 

So that is the experiment.

I have also noticed that posting in this sub does kind of stress me out sometimes. Because I do have a very controversial view with the thiamine and General Adaption Syndrome theory and my relentless trying to spread hope that recovery is possible, but that it's a highly individual process. No one size fits all. I do get quite a lot of harsh backlash from people whom I offend with such view on the sub. 

I feel like people mistake my personal view on how individuals can get better, with a political view that ME/CFS can be cured for everyone simply by x,y,z. 

After I got better from the thiamine I swore to myself that I would spread the word about thiamine and also that I will make sure to share my story so that people keep believing in recovery. And I have done so for quite some time now. But on a stress level this is taking its toll. I can physically feel the stress in my chest when someone is harshly telling me off under one of my comments, because it rubs them the wrong way. Or even if my posts are being downvoted with no explanation as to why. Or if I felt misunderstood. 

Yesterday I found a recovery story on the sub of a few years ago that I found really remarkable. Unfortunately I can't seem to find it now to link to it. The guy who had posted it said that he recovered by asking himself before every action he took ""is this helping my health? Is this beneficial for my recovery?"" And he applied it to all he ate, all he watched (videos) and all he did in general. Before he applied deodorant, he would ask himself. And then he would stop it, if he came to the conclusion that it probably is not beneficial.

And I thought to myself, wait a minute... why am I putting myself through the stress of this posting business?

I was trying to stand above it for so long, but now with this new attempt to ground myself in my body, I have to acknowledge and admit that my body does react very sensitively to that kind of rejection. And I don't want to keep putting myself through that anymore.

I decided to make this post for the people who are following me and for whoever else stumbles across one of my former posts on thiamine or whatever comment and then checks to see how I am doing now.

I will unsubscribe from the CFS sub as an experiment, so I am not even tempted to respond to posts.

I will try out this approach of only doing things that I feel help my recovery.  

This is my experiment."

I (19F) was diagnosed with N1 about four months ago, but I cannot figure out if I'm really experiencing cataplexy.

It's like I lose the sense my arms are totally connected to my body and I only feel like dragging them around. My eyes are usually drooped. 

I can control it to a relatively normal level if I have to, but I've heard that cataplexy is completely uncontrollable. 

I also cannot figure out any specific triggers for when that happens. Nothing specifically happens before hand usually when I feel this happen. Sometimes if I'm laughing REALLY hard I feel the need to collapse on the ground (but I can keep myself standing if I actually have to) I'll feel my face become more slack and my speech slightly slurs, but I don't know if this is cataplexy.

My face and other parts of my body will randomly twitch and spasm, almost feeling like the muscles bubbling. And sometimes my thighs feel disconnected to my body and I really need to sit down. I'm also really clumsy and tend to run into things.

Hello!

I am clinically diagnosed with Social Anxiety, Generalized Anxiety, and ADHD. I recently started seeing a psychiatrist for the ADHD and ended up being treated for that and put on Zoloft for the Anxiety combo. The medication worked wonderfully and immediately boosted my mood and happiness x10. She mentioned that she believes I have Major Depressive Disorder alongside my Anxiety, which threw me for a loop. I know of one major depressive episode that I have had in the past, so I found it odd that she felt I fit the diagnostic criteria for it. I agree with it now after taking time to think about my life and mood, but I was thrown off at first.

She talked about how it sounded like I had been depressed most of my life, and how I had a hard time recognizing what was and wasn't depression because I have never had a moment away from it. After meeting with her and thinking about it, I agree. She explained that neurotypical people experience sadness based on circumstance and things happening, and that they have a baseline of happiness, which I do not have. My baseline has always been sadness or inward negativity.

So, I researched and found Dysthymia (Persistent Depressive Disorder) that I feel fits my experiences, but I am still confused on a few things and wanted to ask you all your opinions and experiences. I never felt that I qualified for depression and would always push off the thought that I had it when it popped in my head. So, I am having a hard time telling what is depression and what ""normal"" is. I asked my neurotypical husband his general emotional state and he said happy, and I explained how mine was always sad - even as a kid. I thought that what I was experiencing was what everyone else was dealing with, but now I am reconsidering whether it was depression or not.

So, I don't know... I suppose I am just a bit confused and having a hard time telling what is depression and what is not. How did you guys realize that you had been depressed most of your life? Was it very noticeable, or did it seem like ""normal"" living? How can you tell whether you are depressed? What is the difference between ""big"" and ""small"" depression?"

I have a friend who struggles with gout. He has for many years and has tried many treatments. Im sure that a lot of his problem was brought on by unhealthy lifestyle. 

He found a medicine from Mexico that helps him with the pain immediately and has been using it for a few years now. He basically needs this to function, otherwise the gout will be so bad he is bedridden in extreme pain. 

He went to the doctor recently and the they are trying to wean him off of this unknown medication. A lab to get it identified costs about $30k so thats not money he wants to spend. His doctor thinks its a steroid but no one really knows.

The part that is a real mystery for me is that he has had a very strict diet for the past three months and hasnt really lost any weight. No alcohol, no carbs or sugars except some fruit. My suspicion is this mystery medicine is preventing the weight loss. He does have diabetes but his sugar is under control just from the diet so he isnt taking diabetes meds, my first thought was the diabetes meds could be the cause of the weight not being shed but since hes not taking the diabetes meds it might be the unknown medicine from Mexico thats preventing the weight loss.


He does also take meds for high blood pressure. He also suffers kidney stones and pain, I am thinking as a side effect of the other medicine. Also his liver is in bad shape but it did improve recently evidenced by his lab tests. He has fatty liver. 


Does anyone know what kind of medicine it could be? Its unmarked pills. Has anyone here ever used a medicine that gives relief as fast as this? If anyone here is thinking to take it please dont. It doesnt solve the problem. It just kicks the can down the road.

Im not sure how to fix the issue. If he stops cold turkey he will be out for a few weeks at least in extreme pain.

Lately this feeling of just wanting to zone out is strong because of all the burn out i'm facing with work and school - and the attitudes the pandemic and political landscape has caused. School in particular has been a struggle because I keep constantly asking myself, what's the point? Am I making a mistake? I don't have time to get good grades, I must get good grades! Why can't I do better? This ultimately leads to strong imposter syndrome.

t5_2r4lw,s8gwia,I should imagine having some sort of cancer of the nervous system that is stable but with awful symptoms.,"[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","Doctor changed my life by telling me he cannot help me
First time poster long time lurker here.

Basically the title.

A few days after Thanksgiving I once again ended up in hospital during a crash not being able to speak properly. They had a doctor there who didn't even speak proper English and I just thought here we go. It's in my chart that I have ME and POTS and he knew what it meant and just seemed to shake his head when he looked at me. They only did an ecg and blood work which both came back fine. They then told me they can't help me. I started crying and said I wish I had cancer because then I'd get proper care. Later on the guy came back and said to me he thinks it's like me having cancer anyway. That I should imagine having some sort of cancer of the nervous system that is stable but with awful symptoms. Life expectancy is around another 50 years. All the therapeutic options have not stopped it from being there, but it will not kill me. There is nothing that he or the hospital can do to treat it. He looked me straight in the eyes and said something like: ""Listen to me. We can not help you. There is nothing we can do. Do you hear me?""

I just stared at him. He then said all they can do is what he can offer patients with untreatable cancer. Pain meds and xanax which he would be happy to prescribe.

I went home to tell my husband that I had like cancer of the nervous system and there's nothing they can do but at least I won't be dying of it. My husband asked whether this was good news or bad news. I said I didn't know. 

Then I started feeling better. It's been two months now and I have been feeling better than the last couple of years.

It's odd because nothing has changed. I am not taking any vitamins or anything. But I feel much calmer thinking that I have cancer that won't kill me and doctors can not treat it either. I have noticed that instead of waking up and thinking why am I feeling so bad I now wake up thinking this is my cancerlike state. This won't kill me. This is my normal. No need to worry. 

It's a strange kind of calm that seems to have come over me. 

It's extremely odd to think that a doctor telling me that he can not help me has helped me feel so much better."

Any tips on coping with a depressive episode?
I was depressed for years. During this time was also diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD, and started stimulant medication. My last big depressive episode was 2 years ago, I've had little dips and had to be careful in the winter, but I stopped taking antidepressants 10 months ago.

Recently, I've been in such a foul mood. It started out as just feeling sad seemingly for no reason, but now all my old symptoms are back: brain fog, irritability, increased appetite, fatigue, lack of motivation, nothing is interesting anymore and I'm in pain. I had surgery a little over two weeks ago. Initially I felt fine, but in the last week and a half I've taken a complete nose dive. I know depression can sometimes occur after surgery, but I thought I would be able to handle it. But now that I'm actually experiencing it I feel completely incapable. I'd forgotten how effective depression is at tricking me into believing I'm small, weak, immature, and universally hated.

I know I don't have to keep feeling this way. I know there are steps that I can take, but some of them are not feasible right now. The earliest appointment I can get with my psychiatrist is Jan 12th, and my therapist is out till the 17th. Exercise always makes me feel better, but I don't think my surgeon is going to clear me to go back to it for another 3-4 weeks. I can start taking Vitamin D again, but I feel like that's the only thing I can do.

I'm so frustrated and lost and sad, and it feels like my ADHD medication doesn't even work now. If anyone has any tips to get over this, or at least cope for a few weeks, I would really appreciate it."

t5_2s0tv,s3idmn,I may have subclinical hypothyroidism and wrote that in my chart,"[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","Why are doctors so tied to >10 TSH??
I have seemingly textbook symptoms (hair loss, can't lose weight, dry skin, hair loss, elevated cholesterol, fatigue, brain fog, joint issues, always cold, low natural body temp, constipation, irregular periods, anxiety, etc), abnormal thyroid labs, and a significant family history (basically everyone on my mom's side, and my dad).

My PCP told me in no uncertain terms that she wouldn't treat me for hypo until my TSH is >10. She finally at least put anything in my chart about hypo after I showed her the labs I got from LetsGetChecked that had my TSH above the range and T4 as below, to which she said I may have subclinical hypothyroidism and wrote that in my chart, but instead of thyroid meds, put me on anxiety meds and then 6 weeks later tried to up my dose. I stopped taking them since they upset my stomach.

After that I made an appointment with endocrinology (no referral) because I was sick of it, waited 3 months to see a PA who said my thyroid is fine, didn't believe me when I said I had all of that family history but at least my mom and I have both been tested for antibodies and don't have Hashimotos. She at least offered to monitor my TSH (once a year...), but she also said unless I get over 10 they won't treat me because ""It'll make your thyroid lazy"". But she did tell me all about the apps her therapist recommended to her, since clearly my symptoms are ""pandemic stress"". Ma'am, this has been going on for 10+ years...

I have a list of a bunch of journal articles recommending treatment, I think I'm going to start handing them out to my doctors next time. I feel like a shell of a person, I get home from work and collapse I'm so tired. Even the hair loss is starting to interfere with my job by getting hair in my lab work, and I'm so tired of everyone saying it's just anxiety. My old doctor wanted to start me on a low dose, but I was in school across the country and couldn't come back for the 6 week follow up. I'm starting to think I should have just flown back for it. My mom showed my labs to her doc and even they said I need a new doctor. Unfortunately, it seems everyone in the health system I can see seems to have the same view. **Anyone have any recommendations for doctors in the Madison, WI area?**

TL;DR - Drs are treating a number, not the patient, and won't prescribe meds until TSH is >10 and say instead its just anxiety. Anyone have any recommendations for doctors in the Madison, WI area?

It won't let me add photos to include all my labs, but my vitamin D was a bit low, I'm taking supplements for that now. My thyroid labs are below:

I had my first gout attack in my early 20's and was able to avoid future flare-ups for a while via changing my diet and taking 1.8 mg colchicine upon (suspected) onset of symptoms. I'm otherwise healthy, active and fit, but because every male relative on both sides of my family has suffered from gout, I knew it would only be a matter of time until the lifestyle changes were not sufficient. I had no attacks for about 7 years, but I've since had 2 flare-ups in the last 6 months. I told myself that I'd start Allo if I began having >1 attack per year, so now I intend to do so. 

I've read that one should be clear of gout symptoms before starting UA-lowering therapy, and while I can now put on shoes, walk, etc, I still have some residual pain in both big toe joints from my two most recent attacks. I recall that the lingering pain from my first attack didn't clear completely for nearly a year. So my question is this: Do I need to wait until the pain is *completely* gone to start UA-lowering therapy? Or can I start now that the most acute part of the flare-up is passed?

I do have an appointment to see a rheumatologist, but it won't be for quite a while, so I'm considering starting Allo with my primary care physician, since I'm eager to get on it."

I have not had any pregnancies in the 10 months, I test from 10 DPO until I get my period so I am fairly confident there have not been any chemical pregnancies.

Hi there! I am wondering if anyone who had a super high TSH seemed to experience more (and new) symptoms the closer they got to having a normal TSH.

For example, I was diagnosed in May of 2021 with a TSH of 213. I have slowly been getting increases in my dosage, and it will usually take like 2-3 weeks before I really start to feel the effects, Ill feel weird for a while, and then I start to feel more levels out.

My main question  is it common to have had seemingly no anxiety in the past only for it to pop up suddenly as you get closer to a normal TSH range?

Hi, Ive been to a few psychotherapists. Only one of them, after not that many meetings, found out that I suffer from dysthymia. Other two therapists I worked with were likely to suggest me that Im simply not interested to be in a therapy. And I literally was made (I think unconsciously) guilty of the failure of their method of work. But as far as I go through my depression-like issues I believe its these specialists who fail to identify my issues properly.

But whats the point of it, dysthymia is a form of depression, right? Yes, but what I notice the most often is that they try to explain me situations Im into, but I Im completely aware of them. They want me to behave logically as soon as I get familiar with my wrong behaviour, but, in fact, I already am. And they play surprised when there is no shift in my daily scheme. Because this is the issue  I cant change them.

Is it really hard to find a proper specialist who can help in these conditions? Or I have a bad luck? How to suggest my next psychotherapist what kind of problem I deal with? Simply saying them dysthymia didnt work out last time."

I'd kind of been wondering based on reading about persistent depression / chronic depression / dysthymia and I started seeing a new therapist (with a doctorate, this time!). I told her about the inside of my head and she said ""Oh, yeah, that's depression.""

""But I can always get out of bed in the morning! I just sometimes feel like I'm piloting a meat-puppet and have to pretend that we're not all walking corpses doing pointless meaningless things in our pointless meaningless world because it's not socially acceptable to point that out.""

""Yes, that low background hum of depression is a thing called chronic depression.""

So ... I'm really relieved to have a diagnosis because I've been this way as long as I can remember and it's just that - a low hum of intermittent mild intrusive mind-glitches (I can't cross a road without thinking about throwing myself under a car. I can't ride the subway without thinking of jumping in front of it. But it's constant and I never do it!) Meds aren't currently on the table because I have a lot of supports in place that work well (sleep schedule, job, social circle, hobbies, spouse, exercise) and it's just kind of that low hum so we're doing some talk therapy first.

I guess ... I kind of wanted to check in with other people? I'm feeling both really relieved and really thrown that I have an actual mental illness diagnosis that feels scarily accurate and - to quote one of the best Depression Bands ever - I'm kind of ""Afraid of change / Afraid of staying the same.""

Does it depend on whether the depression is primary (existing on its own) or secondary (caused by uncontrolled EDS)?
I have been diagnosed with both IH and depression. Recently, I posted a more detailed question about Sunosi (solriamfetol) vs. Wellbutrin (bupropion), where I explained that I was forced to taper off of Wellbutrin due to a seizure and was trying out Sunosi instead. Sunosi isnt approved for treating depression, but it has a very similar mechanism-of-action to Wellbutrin (they are both NDRIs). 

The answers were helpful, but Im still lost as to whether I should try out Sunosi alone for the next 6 weeks or if I should ask my doctor for an antidepressant at my upcoming appointment. Since my symptoms are very debilitating, Id like to minimize the trial-and-error phase as much as possible.

Unfortunately, my psychiatrist has little knowledge of Narcolepsy/IH, and my sleep specialist isnt well versed in treating depression. So I feel like I have to come in with enough knowledge to be able to advocate for myself. 

Whats making this more confusing is that Im not sure if my IH is causing my depression or just exacerbating it. If I get my EDS under control, will the depression go away too? Wellbutrin helped me with both - does this mean that my conditions have a shared pathophysiology (dopamine/norepinephrine deficiency)? 
Do these questions even matter when it comes to Sunosi? In other words, can Sunosi treat primary depression too, or only secondary depression caused by EDS?

This brings me to my main question - has anyone with both narcolepsy/IH and depression successfully treated both conditions with Sunosi alone? If not, what antidepressants (other than Wellbutrin) do you recommend that are narcolepsy-friendly (dont worsen EDS)?"

I think I have had dysthymia or dysthymia like symptoms for the past 5 years, but have been managing to be high functioning for all this time with only shorter periods 1-2 weeks of stronger depression-like episodes, triggered both spontaneously and by stress.  Last Summer I started studying at a well recognized engineering school and even managed after moving out from my parents to create healthier habits, such as sustained weight loss, improved self care and overall independent living. However after an initially stressful December I had a relapse and had two weeks where I slept 14 hours a day, lost appetite and stopped going to school etc... This resulted in me struggling with several midterms, leading to my mother discovering I felt like I had dysthymia. She booked me an appointment with our long time family doctor and has been supportive, but I dont think she understands what I feel like. Today I had the appointment and I tried to explain that I though I had dysthymia or something similar. The doctor asked a few generic questions: living conditions, past stress, eating habits, but never actually asked about how I was processing emotions, anxiety, how it influenced relations or about my suicidal thoughts. I could have tried to explain it further and raise those points, but I was already stressed out from just talking about the simpler stuff and as soon as he didnt ask I felt that I couldnt or shouldnt mention them. The end result is I left pretty quickly, supposed to talk to him again in six weeks and see how things develop. I somehow got it into my head that finally talking to a doctor would help me feel like my struggles are valid and that I dont have to solve it myself, but there was medicinal help. Now I just hope that I can get this time to blow over and go back to how I was managing before, without my parents knowing about it or having to talk to the doctor again.

I would consult my doc, but they are closed over the weekend, so I figured if I knew a bit about yalls experiences, I could make a more informed decision for myself."

Advice/experience
Hello, I dont post often but stumbled upon this wonderful subreddit last night as I couldnt sleep due to the pain.

Im M/27 and overweight/heavy drinker. After getting married a few months ago I decided it was time for some changes and went to my PD for the first time in years. Had gained about 80lbs since going when I was 21 and told the doctor I had been drinking about 6/7 days. My liver enzymes were about 3 times elevated. In the weeks since then Ive lost about 10 pounds and had quit drinking on weekdays and doing moderate exercise/eating a much healthy diet(which did include a lot of chicken and fish)

About two weeks ago I woke up thinking I had broken my ankle. After suffering for a few days I went to urgent care thinking I had a blood clot or something and they told me it was gout. Prescribed me prednisone and hydrocodone. I started feeling better within a day and was pretty much back to normal by the following week. 

However I have another flare up now and cant walk again. Im trying to go to see my PD because Im not sure if I should really be taking prednisone and hydrocodone with my high liver enzymes. Ive seen a lot of talk about colchicine and allopurinal. Just wondering if anyone else has similar experiences and knows if these would be better for me. Also, Im guessing cutting back to weekend only drinking is not going to be enough to stop the attacks.

Thanks Im advance"

Hello! Throughout the last 1.5 years I've been eating maybe 2 cans of sardines a day on average. I realize this sounds crazy but almost everything I read showed that sardines are like salmon but without the mercury and there were even articles saying daily consumption of sardines is safe. A few months ago I had a minor gout attack (very small amount of pain) and didn't realize what it was. Then I had a much worse one 2 months later, realized what it was, went on NSAIDS etc. The pain went away almost immediately from NSAIDs, literally in 10h maybe (at least it went to 1% of what it was) the swelling went down but stayed a bit and never really went away. A few weeks later I went to the beach, had some champagne and lobster (I had read lobster wasn't so high in purines, less than chicken) [https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf](https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf) and hoped that this wouldn't do anything. I also went on a hike the next day. The day after that I got another gout attack (worse than first, not as bad as second). 

I have totally cut out sardines and pretty much all meat from my diet, I've never really had any sugar in my diet except through fruit, I follow a very strict diet 99% of the time (except when celebrating). Pretty much just oatmeal, eggs, kale, avocados, etc). 

I have read that gout can't be cured, that it's caused by a number of factors outside of diet including kidneys unable to flush uric acid quickly enough, enzymes in body from genetics producing too much uric acid, autoimmune and inflammation issues etc. I have had my kidneys tested and they flush uric acid at a normal rate, I have had my chronic inflammation levels tested (through c reactive protein liver tests) and it is normal as well. I also have had my uric acid tested at 7.9 (months after cutting out sardines). 

It seems completely reasonable that gout could be caused temporarily by a huge amount of purines and uric acid (like if you injected yourself with uric acid and got your rate to 20 or 30 for example, physically it seems like it would ALWAYS crystalize at high enough levels. For this reason (not necessarily arguing that it's true in my case) it seems like gout could be cured in some cases by lowering uric acid levels (only in people who would never get it normally and had some action that caused a huge amount of abnormal build up like eating 2-3 cans of sardines a day). 

However, I have not read anything about gout being ""cured"" and this sub seems to mainly say that diet actually has a limited impact and rarely helps (most people seem to recommend allopurinol). I totally understand this, for many people gout is caused by the factors I mentioned above, not changed by diet, but it seems reasonable that crazy diets could cause temporary gout, cured through the normalization of that diet. Is there some flaw in my reasoning here?"

Indeed, as muscle cells express abundant angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), the virus likely exploits the myocytes, engendering disabling symptoms such as fatigue and weakness (Ferrandi et al., 2020; Jin and Tong, 2020; Mao et al., 2020). For example, preclinical studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-upregulated angiotensin II (ANG II) disrupts the muscle cell autophagy, impairing both the metabolism and contractility (Neel et al., 2013; Silva et al., 2019). However, aside from directly accessing the myocytes, this virus can induce myopathy, muscle weakness and atrophy indirectly by upregulating proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1 beta (IL-1) and 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (VanderVeen et al., 2019; Guidon and Amato, 2020; Jin and Tong, 2020). When persistent, exertional and unrelieved by rest, myopathy may gradually morph into ME/CFS, a severe illness, affecting up to 2.5 million Americans (Blomberg et al., 2018; Friedman, 2019).

Hi - New here. Just saw a Rheumatologist last week due to 7+ foot attacks in a year. Im 33, good overall health, but I get this pin that begins in the side of my foot and slowly over 7-10 days works it way through my full foot. This can happen in both feet, but never at the same time. My Uric Acid came back at 8, which according to Google is high. Dr started discussing alapurnol as a solution once she reads the labs and confirms. 

Anyways, when I went to the doctor I explained that I felt like the pain could be coming on. She prescribed me a prednisone taper in case - has this worked for anyone else to help quickly get the pain under control? If so, how long? 

In the lead up to this attack, I have body aches and a low grade fever. Anyone else experience this? 

Anyways, new here and a little worried. Really looking forward to a diagnosis and moving past this."

I guess I've always known I'm bulimic, but it's a strange thing that I don't even see as an illness or a problem really. I don't do it so much anymore, but have done it more recently, due to wanting to lose weight. I guess in that way my bulimia has remained quite dormant for a few years now.

I used to frequently binge and purge, like you know the drill.. go and buy all the foods you know are just gonna end up down the toilet. For me, I used to do this when I knew I'd be alone for a few hours or the night, I loved it in many ways. 

I 'tried' to do this again the other night - repeating the process I knew so well - but I really didn't enjoy the binging aspect anymore. I guess I went through my 'honeymoon' period of this ritual years ago. As I've got older I guess I'm more drawn to throwing up if I've eaten 'too much. Has bulimia become this way for anyone else as they have gotten older?

To me, doing this occasionally (admittedly more frequently atm) isn't really that bad. I even question if just doing it occasionally is even really bulimia?"

> It feels like your heart is broken and youre the one who broke it. Its literally a heart breaking sadness. Betrayal like the time you told yourself youd change, youd get better, youd make more of an effort, and you didnt.

> Its a gut wrenching emptiness. It feels like failure. All. The. Time. You cant even fucking be alive right. Loser.

> Just get your shit together. Try harder.

> Get the fuck over it. Youre weak.

> It feels like hopelessness. Every effort you ever make is never going to be enough. Youre running out of time. Youre useless and pathetic. Just give up.

> It feels like hurt. Like being called stupid, and lazy, and unhealthy, and ugly. Except youre the one pointing a finger in your face saying it.

> It feels like youre 3 years old and you lose your mom in a store but really youre 30 and you havent been to the store in 3 weeks because putting a key in your car is just too much work. 

> It feels like disappointment but youre the one youre disappointed in. Like failing freshman year of college because you couldnt manage to get out bed. And youre trying to explain how sorry you are but you and yourself both know there arent any excuses. 

> Grow up, youre so irresponsible.

> It feels overwhelming and vast and never ending. It feels like 3 months worth of laundry piling up on your floor. Youll get to it when you feel better. Tomorrow. The next day. Maybe the day after that. You collapse in the pile and cry instead. 

> It feels claustrophobic, like theres never a full breath in your lungs. It feels like drowning and gasping for air while staring at your phone declining plans. Again.

> Shitty friend. Flake.

> Its feeling like being home sick. When youre sitting on your own couch, in your own living room, in your own house. Surrounded by everything youve abandoned.

We had read all the polls on Health Rising and other places and been terrified of vaccinating her for fear of making her CFS worse, but omicron's increased transmission risk forced our hands. So she finally got vaccinated (Moderna, both doses), and... it was fine! She was knocked down for a day each time, and had some minor symptom flares for a week after each one, but nothing like the catastrophic crash we had feared. Two weeks after her second dose, she's back to her (admittedly crummy) baseline.

So while we still think she was wise to hold out as long as she did, given the available dataand we have huge sympathy for everyone who's had bad reactionswe wanted to share her experience to give hope to other severe CFS folks looking to get the vaccine. There's risk, but it also might be just fine. And it's a huge relief to have that extra protection against Covid!

I have CFS and POTS. Since May 2021, I have been experiencing symptoms beyond my usual fatigue and lightheadedness.

It first started with vertigo, but only while lying down. It then progressed to regular headaches and migraines, and I currently experience these symptoms:

- vertigo (worse when lying down, especially on back)
- head pressure (again, worse while lying down) pressure also is in jaw and cheeks
- inability to hold head up when upright 
- near constant dizziness, like someone is suffocating my brain 
- increased panic attacks and anxiety, and severe emotional distress 
- body weakness 
- headaches, particularly on the right side base of my skull
- neck and shoulder pain
- tremors (horrible, I can spend up to hours shaking)
- sensitivity to light, screens, motion (writing this is making me very ill)
- dizziness can be triggered by moving neck

I thought I had vestibular migraines so I saw a headache specialist who works by treating the c2 vertebrae. Following my first two treatments, my symptoms got drastically worse. Ive lost so much sleep because I cant lie down without everything spinning. I feel like Im losing my mind and I dont know why. I find myself hysterically crying over how I feel and Ive never been like this before. 

i have to spend most of the day lying perfectly still with my eyes closed because even the tiniest of movement can trigger my symptoms.

Im not sure if there is a CCI sub but I know there  are a few cases of CCI with CFS/ME hence me posting here. 

To those that have knowledge in CCI - do my symptoms align with this condition? And if so how do I go about seeking a diagnosis? (Im in Australia)

Hi everyone. This is my first time posting on Reddit ever so bear with me. 

I don't have an official dysthymia/PDD diagnosis but I strongly suspect I have it. I never thought I had major depression and always saw myself as having ""depressive tendencies."" So when I discovered dysthymia and looked into the symptoms it really resonated with me. 

Something that I'm struggling with right now is that I'm not able to really enjoy anything or have meaningful experiences. I'm in college right now and it seems like everyone around me is having the time of their lives (which I know isn't true, but it seems that way). Personally, I feel like I'm just here. I'm just existing. 

I also joined a sorority this year in the hopes of finally having a solid group of friends. It's been hard to meet people in the chapter because of COVID restrictions and as a result it feels like another situation where I'm just \*there\*. It doesn't mean anything to me and it's frustrating because I see so many girls whose sorority means the world to them. 

Does anyone else struggle with this? I look around and I feel like I'm the only person here that just can't enjoy themselves."

I'm aware that there are many diet trends from various Youtube doctors and that not everything makes a whole lot of sense, but this refined vegetable oil thing seems pretty big to me as regards mitochondrial health.

Just wanted to share for those of you who are interested in the mitochondria theory and who think that they can do stuff to promote health in the mitochondria.

I'm not saying this fixes CFS (and neither are the doctors who are being interviewed saying such thing), but better mitochondrial health will maybe raise quality of life for some of us.

My biggest mitochondria revelations so far have been high dose thiamine plus basic vitamins and minerals (no fancy stuff, just the very basics) and quitting sugar and alcohol. I'm quite excited to be finding more things that I can try in my attempt to recover and I thought I will share these two ideas with you as I'm particularily excited about them.

I'm kind of taking a bit of a break from engaging in the subreddit too much, because it has been stressing me out, but I still feel very connected to the sub in a good way too. 

Hope you're having a good or ok day everyone!"

There are many posts on here of people who have benefited (note that I didnt say been cured) a lot from changing their diet, yet all they get is down votes when they share their stories.

Been lurking around reading all the recommendations from you guys. Very appreciative of the tips.

Have some questions for anyone out there who is able to help.

Was feeling foot pain and my family doctor refereed me to a podiatrist who stated it's most likely gout.  I initially thought it was a bunion. Got x-rays and blood work done. X-rays negative for arthritis or broken bones but blood work showed my results as, A538. Reference range should be 150-430.

Flare ups  come and go and last approximately 2-3 days.  I took 2 weeks off work and that really helped relieve pressure on the foot. I went back into work this week and on the third day back, it started to flare up again. I'm required to wear ankle high boots at work and i'm wondering if that may be a factor for the flare ups?

&#x200B;

So few questions,

&#x200B;

1) Are the work boots a factor? Does anyone else have a similar experience?

2) Based off the blood work results of 538 and the maximum range is 430. What steps should I be taking to help lower that number?

3) Based off what i've read, it sounds like allopurinol seems to be helpful so I plan on contacting my family doctor for a prescription for that."

Hey all, I'm getting my first sleep study done in April and was wondering if anyone could share experiences with their own sleep studies. I'm far from nervous, but I'm just curious about what I should expect. Not just the study itself, but anything involved with it.

I have very a strong family history of Narcolepsy, as my biological mother and grandmother were both diagnosed with it. I have a problem with inheriting any genetic disease under the sun. During my adolescence, I began developing strange sleeping patterns that are presenting as narcolepsy w/ cataplexy.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis, I'm on my way to receiving one, but I'm asking if anyone else had anything to share for someone about to have their first sleep study.

Again, I'm not nervous. I've had a lot of medical appointments for a whole assortment of medical problems (might have my third MRI soon) so just anything anyone could share regarding their own experience getting a diagnosis would be helpful. I've had similar questions regarding other medical problems, so I figure actually reaching out this time for something like this would be helpful. Thank you.

TL;DR: I'm getting a sleep study to help diagnose Narcolepsy, and any experience someone has had similar to this would be helpful to know.

(I can supply additional information if needed. Again, I'm not asking for a diagnosis. I'm in the process of receiving one lol.)

Maybe get 2-3 flares a year...but more if I put a lot of pressure on my feet from over-use or get dehydrated etc.

The flare seems to have been caused by a new ARB and FloMax prescription for some blood pressure and prostate concerns....but I digress...still working on that possibility.

Went to the local clinic for more advice as can't get to my regular doc on short notice, and he suggested prednisone.  We discussed (after seeing many posts here) also going on Allopurinal for a longer term solution once I get this bout fixed and I'll look at that down the road.

Problem is, I am not sure if I should be continuing the indo AND the colchicine AND prednisone I got today all at the same time?  Seems to be an either/or, not both...but I forgot or did not get clear advice.  Just a few hours after taking the prednisone, I could literally feel the gout ""melt"" away and pain is almost completely gone already....wow.

Pharmacy is closed tomorrow as well as doctor.

Hello everyone!

I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism one week ago and recently started a treatment with 25 mg of euthyrox and at the beggining of next week raising a dose to 50 mg. I'm excited and kinda happy for probably knowing a reason of how I was feeling in the past. So I just have a few questions about it, because I couldn't find an precise answers on internet yet.

1. How long does it take to start feeling better during treatment?
2. Can hypothyroidism cause heart problems like heart skipping and feeling weak, heart blocks, light chest pains, also getting sometimes (can be really vary one per day, few per day, one for week etc.) kind of lets say 2-3 seconds of heart palpitation and can a treatment stop those symptoms? I have it since few months. Because even if I was feeling really sleepy, tired, mentally bad and have other symptoms, feeling that something's wrong with heart make me really worried. My doctor said that hypo can cause it, but I'm really interested in your experiences.
3. So if answer is yes to question no. 2, can it be cured just by euthyrox?
4. Is the 6.5 TSH a high enough score to have that symptoms or maybe it's more to other issues or it's just to fast to verify it now?
5. Can levothyroxine cause some insomnia? Because since yesterday I have much more troubles to fell asleep and when finally I'm able to, mostly I wake up after 2 hours or something like that.
6. Does alcohol make you feel really bad after drinking when you are hypo? For example after new year party I was feeling really shaky, had irregullar heart rate around 100 bpm, pressure problems and chills over my face and body.

Thank you for your answers and I'm really sorry for my lack of english medical and overall language skills "

On a much more serious note: This was the worst gout attack of my life. Im 30, and was first diagnosed with gout when I was 16 (thanks mom). 

The first feeling of gout occurred immediately after my buddies wedding last month where we all enjoyed way too many adult beverages

As we know, it started with that bone-shaking tingling feeling. Which rapidly moved into a full blown attack with what looked like a golf ball lodged in my big toes joint. 

Sure, prednisone and indomethacin helped But it didnt do the job. This was a bad flare up, like very bad. After drinking gallons of water (to the point of water-toxicity), a good amount of cherry juice, veggies, etc. Nothing was helping. 

To the point, I started googling permanent gout. Yikes. 

Then one day, a good friend of mine asked if I had given acupuncture a shot? I had not. Outside of not being a huge fan of needles, I said what the heck and gave it a try 

I kid you not

One of the best decisions of my life. 

In 5 days, just 3 sessions later, that once described golfball in my left big toe, actually looks better than my right big toe (that doesnt have gout). 

I can walk!

See, the acupuncture was able to reduce the tension in my joints and drive my immune system to the point of the pain. After 1-2 weeks, the body registers the attack as non-fatal, so it lets up on the focus to pay attention to other bodily needs. 

Furthermore, the acupuncture can help process fluids that have become stale and hard (bone-like) over time. If youve had gout for years like I, this crap is still there and will just compound..

I come to you today, a changed man. This was a lifestyle moment, and a lifestyle change is only fitting. 

If youre going through a gout attack, stay strong! It will pass. And try acupuncture!!

This community helped me out in my time of need. Most people dont get the pain and just laugh or poke a joke at the rich mans disease. You all get it."

One thing that is of great concern to me is a complete lack of sex drive, sensation, or interest in sex. I've been like this for almost 2 years now.

Hi guys,

I'm super frustrated and confused so I figured I'd ask for help here 

I (21f) was diagnosed with OH a few months ago after several years of fainting upon getting out of bed (1-2 times a year, other symptoms as well). Cardiologist did the lying/sitting/standing test, and my heart rate went WAY up, blood pressure stayed the same. He diagnosed me with OH.

I did some research and at the follow-up appointment asked how it would be possible for me to have OH since my blood pressure was totally fine but my heart rate went up, and wouldn't that indicate POTS instead? 

He said (and I quote) ""it's not POTs, cause for POTs we would prescribe more of an exercised-based approach""

Idk if I'm crazy or what, but that doesn't sound like a real answer to me??? The treatment changing isn't a reason to not diagnose someone with something.

 He also said that POTs patients don't faint, which I know isn't true?

I'm just confused and frustrated, I feel like nobody is listening to me. I know that the treatment is the same for both so it doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, and that's fine with me, but I feel totally dismissed and don't really know what to think about the whole situation. 

Thanks for your help :)"

A Belgian study found no difference between brain volume loss (BVL) of healthy individuals and patients with MS (pwMS) that had no evident disease activity (no lesions), also known as NEDA-3.

Citing the article:

**NEDA-3 has recently been launched as an ambitious treatment goal in the clinical management of MS, striving for complete suppression of inflammatory disease activity. In patients who have obtained such a label, a significantly lower rate of BVL was demonstrated across the evaluation period, compared with their counterparts who did not [17,18], although the difference with normal aging has not been extensively investigated yet. Our study now shows a similar degree of whole brain and total gray matter volume decline in patients with MS, as measured between two MRI time points demarcating a period of NEDA-3, and a group of healthy volunteers who were matched for age and sex, suggesting that neurodegeneration can slow down to physiological levels once inflammatory disease activity has been silenced.**

What is NEDA-3?

The term no evidence of disease activity-3 (NEDA-3) has been introduced to identify patients receiving such DMT who are completely free from new relapses, MRI lesion accrual and clinical disability worsening. NEDA-3 is a composite measure with a possible twin significance: i.e., no detectable evidence of inflammation (as manifested by the absence of new relapses and MRI lesions) nor neurodegeneration (as deduced from the clinical stability).

These findings are in line with those from a prospective Norwegian cohort studyto our knowledge, the only other direct comparative trial in this fieldin which 57 patients with early relapsing-remitting MS were stratified into a NEDA-3 (49%) versus EDA (51%) category based on 1 year of follow-up. The authors did not find a statistically significant increase in annualized subcortical gray matter volume loss, using the freely available FreeSurfer (Charleston, MA, USA) analytical software, in the MS patients with NEDA-3, as compared with an age- and gender-matched control group.

*Our conclusions are seemingly contradicted by reports revealing considerable rates of MS patients achieving NEDA-3 to have a whole BVL above the anticipated pathological threshold of 0.4% per year [22,23,24]. However, such general cut-offs are unlikely to be applicable to all participants and a substantial portion was under a lower-efficacy platform DMT regimen (i.e., interferon  or glatiramere acetate), also illustrating the heterogeneity of studies addressing this issue.*

Ive had the hardest time with it and have had most days where Im down including just last week (I did have omicron though so maybe thats why). So bc of omicron I started to take vitamins I knew I was deficient of bc I heart it helps fight the virus. Yes I could have been doing this all along but I was more focused on the savior pills like beta blockers and Clonazepam. PLEASE GET A BLOOD TEST FOR VITAMIN LEVELS!!! I started to take two D vitamins and my prescribed B vitamin (Im superrrrrr deficient in B) consistently along with a couple others and all of a sudden after a couple weeks of consistency my heart rate is NORMAL without beta blockers or Clonazepam even if I stand. My adrenaline feelings have gone away. I looked up what vitamin deficiency symptoms are particularly B and D and its most of what I was feeling everyday!! Heart palpitations, breathlessness, fatigue, etc. this is the only thing I have changed and I have tried so much. My palpitations have gone down too!!! Please please please try this.

Any advice on diagnosis?
Hi everyone, apologies if this ends up being really long! I have suspected I have had POTS for a while now but none of the doctors I have seen seem to really care. I have seen my family doctor and they referred me to a specialist. The specialist said the most common heart condition is SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) and slapped that diagnosis on me. He didnt really do any tests or ask about my symptoms. I went back again and said I dont think its SVT as it isnt acute 5 minute episodes, its chronic fatigue and weakness as well as high HR and intolerance to being in an upright position. He dismissed it and said you know what we never really figure out why people have these issues, they just have them and thats that. He said the fatigue is probably from the beta blockers he has me on for SVT, however its such a low dose I didnt experience any fatigue when I started them.

When I pushed that I really do think its POTS he said ok fine my medical student will do a quick test. They had me lay down on a table, immediately took me blood pressure and HR, then told me to stand, and immediately took my blood pressure and HR again and said well theres no difference in your HR or BP. Im fairly certain that isnt an accurate test for POTS but I didnt argue with them. I also have days where I feel fine and days where just standing to cook some food feels like running a marathon. Of course the day they did the test I felt fine.

I guess my question is how did you get diagnosed with POTS? What symptoms do you experience from having POTS? I also have read that POTS is usually triggered by an accident or severe illness, but I think its something Ive always had.

I feel discouraged from seeking further medical advice because it really doesnt seem like they care. And now Im questioning whether its actually POTS or if I just naturally have a higher HR and am fatigued all the time because of stress or anxiety.. I dont know..

Edit: I just want to add that I feel like I know very little about POTS or any other conditions that it could be. By browsing through the other posts here I think I might be a mild case or borderline possibly? I havent fainted from standing since I was a teenager, but mostly because I know my limits now and will sit if Im having a bad day or can feel myself becoming faint. My HR when standing is usually around 120-130 and laying down between 60-70."

Hello all!

Background info:
- I'm 25F RRMS Brit, living in Europe. Diagnosed last July 2021 after what I suspect was around a year of emerging symptoms. MRI found 20+ lesions in the brain and 3 in the spine. The docs aren't sure if I was a long time untreated or just have rather aggressive attacks. Therapy settled all my complaints and I've been living (so I think) symptomless since then.

I started Tysabri in September 2021, so 5 months now. I have it administered by my neuro at their practice every 4 weeks. Scans show no changes and no active lesions so they want to keep me on it.

Okay so, I'm not doing so well with the health/life balance. The injections are unpleasant but I can deal with that; what I struggle with is the frequency of which I have to have them. I'm quite free spirited, I like to travel, I'm hoping to work nomadically, I like to move around.
I really struggle with feeling like I'm trapped. I'm depressed, caught between enjoying my life and taking care of my condition. I feel like I can't be myself while I'm tied to my neurologist like this. My thoughts are becoming intrusive and the deeper in the spiral I get the more I start to boil it down to numbers and stats. 

I'm increasingly worried about the risk of PML: The hospital MS outpatients repeatedly lost my results, information, cancelled appointments and actually failed to advise me correctly before my diagnosis (even when I had a scan that pointed to MS!) which resulted in a trip to A&E before I was admitted.
I'm terrified that they'll miss something vital and the mistake could be fatal in this delicate situation. 

Has anyone else switched medication or does anyone have Tysabri and have the same feelings/worries?"

Hi all,

I have had MS for maybe 10 years and never got an attack since the first one that brought the diagnose.

I have been incredibly lucky and dont feel much, from time to time a foot that might buzz a little, some of you have probably tried that. I feel super healthy, can run 10k etc., but I feel I get sick pretty frequently during the winter season, which is pretty annoyning.

I figured it might have something to do with the fact that I do take immunosuppressive medicine (Aubagio/Teriflunomide) - I dont feel any side effects from the small pill, but what if I stopped taking it?

I know no one can tell me what will happen, maybe the medicine is the reason why I am not getting any attacks etc., but maybe some of you have been in a similar situation? Has anyone you know stopped taking medicine, what happened, and would there be any good reason to think I might get less sick during winter?

I usually get these small flu-like situations, where I feel pretty bad like something is coming up and then it pretty quickly goes away. Or a sore throat or something similar - I often get these at least 5 times during the winter season (from memory).

I guess a hybrid model could also be considered, where I simply only took the medicine for the warmest 6 months of the year? I live in Scandinavia, so weather is not great usually.

Thanks for the support from such an awesome community, would appreciate any feedback on any of this.

I did try talking to my doctor about this, he simply said ""we don't recommend this"" <-- no big surprise there to be honest :-)...



Edit: So many helpful comments warning me not to stop taking medicine, and also trying to talk to my doctor about all these minor flus I keep getting. I'll definitely listen to your advice, thanks and all the best ."

Hey all,

I have just been at my neuro and finally got confirmed what I assumed all along: I have got MS.


Well, I did quite substantial research on MS beforehand and aimed for high efficacy treatment such as Kesimpta before talking to the doctor. I was very biased towards this treatment as I assumed to have highly active MS for the following reasons: I have multiple lesions in the CNS and spinal cord; one lesion is active while the others are inactive (meaning they occured at different times). I have only had one clinically isolated syndrome however, affecting my sensibility only.

When I talked to the doctor he told me I most likely have a mild version of MS (because it affects my sensibility only) and he would suggest starting with low to mid efficacy medication: copaxone, avonex, rebif, aubagio or tecfidera. When I protested, he told me that e.g. ocrevus or kesimpta would not be paid for by the public health system -> I am living in Europe. And that high efficacy medications would mean a higher risk of side effects. Well, I told him I am aware of this and think it is still a good idea as I want to avoid any further lesions as much as possible but he argued against it (costs too much, risks too high, etc).

I want to add that this doctor is a university professor specializing on MS and often a keynote speaker at international MS congresses. So he should know what he is talking about, also in terms of current research. Still, I don't feel fully convinced and want to ask a second doctor for her recommended plan of action.


What do you think? Is it true that for ""mild"" MS high efficacy treatment is not recommended as a first drug? What are your experiences and what country/continent are you from? These information would help me to better understand his opinion.

THANKS!!


P.s.: I think the prof really didn't like me telling him his opinion is not ""state of the art"" and I am aware this was very insensitive of me to say to a prof but I really felt displeased with his explanations as most of them where about the costs, higher risks and lack of long term studies rather than efficacy of the treatment."

At the end of Grade 10, I was hospitalized at a time when my Math class was just starting a new subject. I studied on my own as best I could, but I missed almost all of the instruction on the subject. When it came time for the test, I got a much lower score than usual, and it put my overall mark down to a B. I mentioned in passing to my Math teacher that I was sad to have my ""streak"" broken. We had a discussion about the subject of the test where she confirmed that I did understand it sufficiently. Without telling me, she went into her records, looked at all my previous test scores, and came up with an average, which is what she assigned me as a score on that final test. This brought my mark back up to an A, and the streak continued! It was such a sweet thing for her to do, and I've never forgotten it.

Hello!  Im a guy with MS who has previously had low testosterone numbers pre-dx (eg below 12 nmol/L).  Ive been feeling especially crappy lately (low energy stuff).  So rather than just accept its MS, I dove into the rabbit hole of trying to find why I feel crappy and came across something interesting that may affect others in here.

Since my dx, Ive been taking supplements to help control my MS.  And my regime and DMT have worked.  My MS went from highly active at dx to NEDA now.  One thing I do every day is I take a flax seed oil + curcumin capsule.

Flax seed oil reduces relapses by 60% according to this study by Dr Jelinik (of OMS diet):

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3821380/

Awesome.  I am only taking 1x1000mg capsule daily- not a lot.  However, apparently when taking with curcumin + piperine, absorption is increased.  

Now, back to me feeling crappy.  I went to an endocrinologist, described symptoms I was having, and she sent me for a blood panel.  It came back with a ridiculously high testosterone number.  Like almost 30 nmol/L - an unnatural number for my age and totally inconsistent with my prior panel.  I should be rocking a massive erection constantly.  But instead, its barely even just okay.  Likewise with body hair, I dont have very much.  And Im hardly very muscular either.  Somethings not right with that number.

So I started reading and found an association between flax seed oil and testosterone that fit:

The reason that flaxseeds are on the hit list for raising testosterone is because they are rich in lignans, which tend to mimic estrogen in the body. Since estrogen is the opposing sex hormone to testosterone, the more of it you have (particularly if you are a man), the more low testosterone-like symptoms youll have. (from: https://www.shawacademy.com/blog/6-foods-to-avoid-to-optimise-natural-testosterone/ )

Also its discussed at length in setting of PCOS at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752973/

Whats interesting is, testosterone is associated with a neuroprotective effect in MS.  (from: https://www.mdedge.com/multiplesclerosishub/article/134428/multiple-sclerosis/testosterone-affects-outcomes-men-ms ).

The effect of estrogen-mimicking lignans fits as a culprit for feeling crappy in a hypogonadism sense - but it also seems to fit the unexplained data from Dr Jeliniks study showing how much more effective flax seed oil was compared to other Omega-3s, since lignans are a unique element not found in fish oils.

If only that Omega-3 study had an endocrine panel, this theory might be solved.  It seems like tapering down flax seed oil intake would help me feel better- but could also reduce beneficial effect of the high testosterone on my MS.

Not sure which path to take.  But an interesting set of associations!  If any smart person has any guidance or this is all wrong, would be helpful!"

Back around the end of July, I was moving apartments and lifted something pretty heavy. It didn't happen right away, but shortly after that, I felt a stabbing pain in my left rib area. It felt like a really bad side stitch, but it didn't go away. For about 3 weeks it was really bad. Every breath I took hurt. I had no idea what was up.

After a while, the pain lessened and I was able to (slowly, and cautiously) start going to the gym again. There were a few things that would trigger it, but eventually I could do pretty much everything at the gym except for sit ups without feeling that stabbing pain. 

But, the pain never *really* went away. I still feel it when I take deep breaths, especially when I'm lying down or my body is twisted in certain positions. 

After a while, I learned about costo, and it sounded pretty spot on. The only things that don't line up are: exercise actually seems to help my pain (resting/doing nothing for long periods of time usually makes the flare ups worse than when I'm being active); and, I've read that costo either goes away or gets continually worse over time. Mine has been stagnant for a while now, some days better than others, but always present. 

I still believed it was costo, and my doctor agreed. I took both naproxen and prednisone for about 10 days, but it didn't help. I also started heating and icing the area, which did seem to help for a time. But, that dull, stabbing feeling always comes back. It's not really interfering with my daily life at this point, but the fear that I'm going to do something that makes it worse is driving me crazy.

I guess my question is - does this sound like costo to you guys? I'm just not sure that's what's up, even if my doctor (who didn't really run any tests or scans or anything) thought my self-assessment was correct. Just wanted to get some opinions before dropping money on further trips to the doc."

They did an EKG and bp test and sent me home with a POTS and high BP diagnosis. 

I can't really pinpoint where the pain is coming from and I'm too scared to keep recreating it to find out but I think it's under my left boob near the bottom of my ribcage more towards the sternum. 

From what I've been reading of others experience with Costo is that it's a fairly constant pain and painful to the touch which mine is not. Mine is just sharp and sudden pain. I can touch all around the area with no pain it's just the deep breaths and now bending over that apparently brings it on."

Hello!  Im a guy with MS who has previously had low testosterone numbers pre-dx (eg below 12 nmol/L).  Ive been feeling especially crappy lately (low energy stuff).  So rather than just accept its MS, I dove into the rabbit hole of trying to find why I feel crappy and came across something interesting that may affect others in here.

Since my dx, Ive been taking supplements to help control my MS.  And my regime and DMT have worked.  My MS went from highly active at dx to NEDA now.  One thing I do every day is I take a flax seed oil + curcumin capsule.

Flax seed oil reduces relapses by 60% according to this study by Dr Jelinik (of OMS diet):

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3821380/

Awesome.  I am only taking 1x1000mg capsule daily- not a lot.  However, apparently when taking with curcumin + piperine, absorption is increased.  

Now, back to me feeling crappy.  I went to an endocrinologist, described symptoms I was having, and she sent me for a blood panel.  It came back with a ridiculously high testosterone number.  Like almost 30 nmol/L - an unnatural number for my age and totally inconsistent with my prior panel.  I should be rocking a massive erection constantly.  But instead, its barely even just okay.  Likewise with body hair, I dont have very much.  And Im hardly very muscular either.  Somethings not right with that number.

So I started reading and found an association between flax seed oil and testosterone that fit:

The reason that flaxseeds are on the hit list for raising testosterone is because they are rich in lignans, which tend to mimic estrogen in the body. Since estrogen is the opposing sex hormone to testosterone, the more of it you have (particularly if you are a man), the more low testosterone-like symptoms youll have. (from: https://www.shawacademy.com/blog/6-foods-to-avoid-to-optimise-natural-testosterone/ )

Also its discussed at length in setting of PCOS at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752973/

Whats interesting is, testosterone is associated with a neuroprotective effect in MS.  (from: https://www.mdedge.com/multiplesclerosishub/article/134428/multiple-sclerosis/testosterone-affects-outcomes-men-ms ).

The effect of estrogen-mimicking lignans fits as a culprit for feeling crappy in a hypogonadism sense - but it also seems to fit the unexplained data from Dr Jeliniks study showing how much more effective flax seed oil was compared to other Omega-3s, since lignans are a unique element not found in fish oils.

If only that Omega-3 study had an endocrine panel, this theory might be solved.  It seems like tapering down flax seed oil intake would help me feel better- but could also reduce beneficial effect of the high testosterone on my MS.

Not sure which path to take.  But an interesting set of associations!  If any smart person has any guidance or this is all wrong, would be helpful!"

[Structural dissociation](https://did-research.org/origin/structural_dissociation/) talks about how trauma and [emotional neglect](/r/emotionalneglect) can split a person's psyche. Emotional parts split off from the apparently normal part, and even the apparently normal part can split.

My own experiences suggest that these kinds of splits can lead to psychosis. The split off parts are not fully walled off, and especially in the right sort of triggering crisis situation, they can intrude into the experience in confusing ways. Because I didn't know those parts of myself well, and wasn't used to working with them, what happened seemed weird and partly supernatural. I wasn't used to processing that, and ended up processing it in an unreasonable way.

The difficult thing here is that when so much of myself was split off via structural dissociation, it's hard to simply ignore it. The only true healing involves finding more reasonable understanding of what happened, and accepting more parts of me back. Otherwise, I'm disabled from missing so much of myself, and disowned parts remain, and potentially cause future problems."

Sorry for the long post but hoping for some advice. I've been having what I think are symptoms of POTS since I had covid last summer, high jump in heart rate on standing up (goes from 75 resting to 130 just on standing up and walking downstairs, and stays high while I'm standing), headaches, fatigue, tinnitus etc. In the UK, you get referred to a ""post covid clinic"" where they decide via telephone appointment what tests/referrals you need, and I was only referred to go for a ""lying to standing blood pressure"" test which was done today.

The nurse didn't seem to have a clue what was needed. She asked if I wanted to lie down or stand first(???), then got me to lay down and immediately took my blood pressure. I was laid down less than 2 minute before she asked me to stand and immediately took blood pressure again, once. It didn't feel like there was any time for my body to adjust to the change in position before any readings were taken. Both were normal, but she didn't look at my heart rate at all, even when I mentioned it was racing. 

As it stands, this result will go back to the post covid nurse who will review it in 6-8 weeks, but I'm not sure that what was done today will show anything at all. Are there particular tests that I should be pushing for that will confirm or negate that this is POTS? I do have the option of using private health cover, but need to know what type of specialist I need, and what type of tests I am asking for. I find it much easier to be assertive with medical professionals if I know what I actually want them to do.

From just a few days of reading it looks common to have go through an  elimination process of other things first. This sucks and is expensive.

I am in this phase. I just saw a cardiologist. 
He said he didnt believe my symptoms were cardiac related. 

My friend is a orthopedic P.A. Just asked him and he doesnt think Costo.  ( not an official office visit) he did say he didnt think a chest X-ray would show anything either. 
He suggested that my spleen could be causing the left side pain. But again there is tender spots on the right too. 


Do you have sore spots on both sides at the same time ? 

So matching tender spots on both sides. 
My left underarm hurts and Im get pin and needle sensations especially the left arm. 
I cant feel and lymph nodes under the arm pit. 

I have a goofed up CBC, but all the tests and panels looking for bone, blood cancers have been negative. 

My C reactive protein was elevated 11.3 mg/l
10 mg/l is the cut off. I read Costo does not elevate CRP. 

In September my CRP was normal. Also in September, CT showed a mildly enlarged spleen. The report said its size was almost the same as an abdominal CT from 2017. 

The CT was abdomen and pelvic. It showed from the lower base of the lungs down I assume it also showed part of my ribs. 
The pancreas was normal too.  So do I ask for another CT ? 

Like many here I am constantly worried there is a cancer somewhere. I just dont feel right most of the time. 

Starting in Sept I developed  erosive gastritis and was passing blood. The gastritis is healing and the colonoscopy was ok ( internal hemorrhoid )

My iron was LOW ( Im a male- so not common at all)
It has been low before but RBC was high. 

My GI provider told me chronic stress can make a spike in the CRP. 

 I have been worrying my self sick with all.  My anxiety has been off the charts for almost two months. 

So why are my ribs and sternum so sore ? 
Why is my underarm puffy and why do I feels pins and needles in different places ? My back hurts around the left shoulder blade.

Im confused and providers are struggling to find a cause for all this. 


I cant say I want this to be costo but I would like to figure this out.

I dont have an ~official~ costo diagnosis but I am confident that is the result of my recent suffering. My costo chose me in the fall of 2020 randomly and went away after 6~ weeks after some doorway stretches relieved the inflammation. Though during this time I had a massive weed-induced panic attack that almost landed me in the ER.

Fast forward to October of this year my costo flares up again after a weed-induced panic attack at a music festival. I knew it wasnt cardiac because weed hasnt killed anyone (I live in California so I got it from a legit spot), but still felt like death was imminent. 

Now my costo is back in full swing with my dullness/mild discomfort on the left side of my chest at my sternum over to my shoulder. For about a 6 weeks after the festival I had about 6 panic attacks that definitely took its toll on me leading me to think I was having cardiac issues. However a chest X-ray, ekg, and blood test showed everything was normal (to my disbelief). 

Ive cut out caffeine and alcohol to the best of my abilities while adopting breathing techniques (highly recommend the Calm app for those with anxiety) and yoga to alleviate the stress your body takes on from panic attacks.

Thankfully Ive had little trouble breathing, but have utilized deep breathing techniques/purchased a shift from Komuso to help with anxiety thoughts that can trigger a flare up.

Also highly recommend CBD! I got a roll on stick that takes the pain away fairly quickly and lasts for several hours.

t5_395ja,s108yu,But after research of this pain my symptoms do not completely match up the online ones,"[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","Unsure if Costo
Hi everyone I just wanted to explain my story with this chest pain that I believe to be costo but unsure. (I have NOT been diagnosed with costo the doctor feels it may be this)

Background
So Im a 19 year old male, active with no previous health conditions. Early last year I experienced a sudden sharp chest pain that lasted a brief few seconds. No other symptoms were experienced but regardless due to it still being chest pain I went to see my doctor. After an ECG they cleared me of the pain being my heart and made the suggestion that this pain was as a result of anxiety or stress. Which to be honest I really did not believe as I was under no stress or anything. Fast forward to summer I was experiencing this sudden on and off sharp chest pain around the left region of my chest. After another trip to the doctors and another ECG they suggested it could be related to acid reflux and I was put on a medication to deal with it for a month but this medicine had no effect as I still felt this on and off pain / discomfort. 

My most recent pain.
After 2 months of no pain I began to feel this same pain, however, occasionally this pain can be felt directly in the centre of my chest and like before it was very sharp, sudden and only lasting for a second or 2 but with this pain it caused me stop in my tracks completely and grasp my chest tightly, a much more powerful sharp pain different from the other ones.This pain made me go to the ER where I had another ECG again nothing coming from it and the doctor suggesting that this may be musculoskeletal pain or costo. Finally something to go off I thought! But after research of this pain my symptoms do not completely match up the online ones. For example my ribs or sternum are not tender and do not hurt when I touch. Also this pain can come on suddenly like when Im at rest / sitting down I will feel this sudden sharp (now occasionally pricking) pain strike my chest and only last a second then go and maybe strike again a few minutes or hours later. I would also sometimes experience breathing difficulties like a heavy chest / racing heartbeat / fluttering feeling but to be honest I think this is from the panic experienced when I feel this chest pain

Next steps.
- After some research I heard about the back pod and I have been using it for the past few days but truthfully no change has been seen. To early to say.
- I have been using heat and ice to help but this does not dismiss the occasiona pain, it has been more of a coping mechanism with the mental toll this has had on me  and just puts my mind to rest.
- I am due to do a blood test, hopefully a chest x ray and I am going to meet a cardiologist in the next month or 2.

My questions
- Do my symptoms point towards costo? ( I ask this as I am concerned about the lack of tenderness experienced when one has costo- making me question my own symptoms and making me spiral into more worry about if this is costo or not) 
- what further remedies or steps would you recommend 

Finally 
What I am currently learning to do is to relax. This chest pain has taken a toll on me mentally, I have been experiencing frequent panic attacks as I always trick my mind into thinking I am dying or due a heart attack any moment now. 
Lol Researching symptoms online really did not help but oh well it led me to this and other websites that helped.

Please any feedback or suggestions would be gratefully appreciated. 

Thank you."

Hi All,

I'm still relatively new here and looking to get some input on my specific situation. 27M. Last year I had an episode of numbness and tingling on my left side (arm and leg). It went away after about 4 days, but the incident kick-started a long line of tests which ended up in my MS diagnosis. I have 6-8 demyelinating brain lesions visible on MRI. All spinal MRIs were clear. I saw an MS specialist who said that only spinal lesions would cause symptoms in the extremities. This means that my MS lesions in my brain did not cause my numbness/tingling and have not caused any symptoms yet. The doctor said that because of this, treatment can be delayed, and I would be monitored every six months or so with an MRI. This is an MS specialist doctor with a reputable clinic.

Is there any merit to this approach in your view? Obviously the idea of delaying these medications is appealing, but I also know it's playing with fire. It's frustrating because in general I have always been averse to taking medication, so what this doctor said what pretty much what I wanted to hear. I don't want to be unwise and risk unneeded damage, but I also wonder if this is in fact radiologically isolated syndrome, which to my understanding *is* supposed to be monitored before treatment starts. I'm just a little stuck on this. 

Any insight or input would be much appreciated. Thank you guys."

Hi all. The past two weeks i've had a really bad flare up with bad chest pain that radiates to my neck and arm (all left side) and sometimes sternum. Particularly triggered by twisting or reaching. I've had a swelling lump/bump on the upper part of my left rib cage for a few years which usually isn't too bad, pain is sometimes triggered by movement in that particular area but luckily never lasts too long until recently. 

I've read lots on this thread that stretching really helps with costo pain, but does it help with Tietze as well what with the added swelling? I'm thinking of getting a foam roller but just want to know if its safe to use with Tietze swelling/pain. In the early stages of this flare up I did try the door frame stretch but i'm worried that really aggravated it - or is it one of those things that needs to get worse before it gets better?

I am also actively working on improving my posture and eating lots of anti inflammatory foods. For info i'm F(26)."

 A research team led by Dr. Marcus Koch and Dr. Wee Yong (Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of AnthoBio) at the University of Calgary that investigates a generic drug, hydroxychloroquine, in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) recently published its clinical study results in Annals of Neurology. The study followed 35 PPMS patients over a period of five years. Throughout the study, 14 patients were expected to develop a significant reduction in their walking function. However, only 8 patients had experienced a reduction by the end of the study. Thats almost a 50% reduction in the number of PPMS patients negatively affected by continuing disability. Although the results will require confirmation in a larger trial, this study has shown that hydroxychloroquine could help slow down the disability progression of PPMS. This study opens the possibility for future treatment option for PPMS and the researchers hope their work will inspire future larger scale clinical research on the drug for PPMS.

Hi all-

Late thirties, male.  A bit of a control freak about my health which is probably why I am down the rabbit hole and worried about this scope next week.

I have always had on/off constipation but typically without any real pain.  Naturally, some discomfort but nothing I would consider pain.  Typically, I would barely go during the week then have a couple normal BMs on the weekend.  I travel a lot and usually eat high protein/a bit short on fiber diet so I do not think much of this.  A couple months ago though, I started having smaller stools and not having my weekend BM's.  When I do have them, they can look sometimes odd shaped with indentions, sometimes square edges and typically no bigger than walnuts although sometimes I get half-way normal looking ones that are about 3 inches in length.  TMI I am sure.  For my diet, I eat spinach and blueberries literally everyday in a shake so the color of everything is usually darker shade of brown but certainly not black. 

Anyways, last couple of weeks I have really upped the fiber to the 38gm/day typically and I have been having BMs daily but, they are still in pieces.  No straining 99% of them time and they just come out clean but, in pieces.  In regards to blood, only once have I seen pink blood on the TP after the day prior I did have to strain and had what I would call a peanut BM.  Have not seen anything else.  Please keep in mind I exercise daily, eat 160-190gm protein/day and around 130gm carbs/day along with 50gm/fat.  Last 2 weeks i have used metamucil and chia seeds to see if it helps.

Went to the GI and expected them to listen to my diet and tell me to try miralax or something else but instead, they talked to me for 5 minutes and decided I should get a colonoscopy.  Based on lots of the info I have read here, that seems strange since some of you guys seem to have to demand one.  So naturally, it makes me nervous to think the docs expect something more sinister but they insisted it was more to rule things out.

So, end of next week I get my first colonoscopy.  From what I have read, IBS usually presents with pain which I have none of.  This makes me a bit anxious.  **Have any of you experienced similar symptoms minus ""pain"" and it been nothing?**  I Have no family history of the big C but, my mom/grandmother/aunt does struggle with bowel issues and mainly constipation so I am hoping I just get it honest.  One of the things that is keeping me somewhat positive is that I had CT scans about 16 months ago for something unrelated and there was nothing in my pelvic/abdomen.  Of course, things can change but at least back then they saw zero.

Sorry for the novel but, really anxious and somewhat neurotic about this."

For example, normally my hug only is around the front of my chest, but its wrapped around my back now like it had in the past. Or maybe thats just what back pain feels like  So perhaps Im just getting typical side effects. I never have any side effects when Im monitored in the hour after my actual IV drip, though. 

I read an old thread on here that someone said she thinks that her immune system is retaliating because it can no longer cross the blood brain barrier. That doesnt sound scientific lol but it makes sense to me kinda. Did anyone else have trouble with their first several tysabri infusions? And how long did it take you to adjust and/or see improvement? This is my very first DMT so I have no experience with anything else. Im hoping I can see some symptom improvement in the future."

I cannot perceive the inside of my mind. Everyone else can see trauma and its effects, know what symptoms of what theyre having, know if theyre lying or not, know if theyre faking an emotion. I have mental psychosis. Every emotion feels like Im faking it, every statement about myself feels like a lie, every symptom of strangeness feels unimportant. Do I not believe in trauma, or did seeing my dad cheat on my mom in 2018 and never saying anything to this day traumatize me? I do not know, I cannot know. It is literally impossible for me to tell if Im suffering or not. I cannot feel emotion as it concerns my own self. What Ive written is true. But my mind cannot comprehend it in any emotional way. 

This is my first time ever reaching out to a psychosis community. I do not have a therapist, I am on antipsychotics. I have always been like this."

Hey all, I hope everyone is coping as well as can be expected at the moment.

If it's OK, I'd like to share some of my experiences as a Physio treating Costo/Tietze in the hope it helps anyone struggling. As someone who is really passionate about trying to better understand the inner workings of musculoskeletal issues, I think I've developed a really broad perspective on what these issues actually are and how to go about getting them to go away.

First and foremost, I understand how challenging and draining these conditions can be particularly when it doesn't feel like you're making progress. They can really debilitate and frustrate even the hardiest person over time! Secondly, I think a large proportion of the medical industry doesn't quite yet fully understand the bigger picture associated with Costo/Tietze and its cause, which often leads to treatment that ultimately misses the mark - despite our best intentions.

And from what I find with my patients, one of the biggest things that get missed a lot is the association between Costo/Tietze and relatively hidden dysfunction around the back. I've posted about this before, but the idea is that a lot of pain at the front/side is a consequence of covert joint stiffness/tightness/overloaded tissue where those ribs insert at the back. I've found looking for and resolving these issues to be a crucial piece of the puzzle for anyone wanting to resolve their symptoms.

Furthermore, I find a really strong link between stress/trauma and persistent Costo/Tietze pain. Whether it be pretty intense past trauma/abuse, or current ongoing work, financial, relationship, religious, cultural stress, etc., these types of things can cause our nervous systems to become chronically heightened over time leaving the door ajar for the pain to develop and hang around. 

In essence, Costo/Tietze (like most aches, pains, and injuries) is more than just a really painful area in isolation. As a fully functioning human being, it's important to take a step back and consider what's going on as a whole in order to get a really strong sense of what's needed to get better.

If it helps, I've put together a far more in-depth video this time for my patients that covers 7 things I think are generally missing from most people's rehab when I see them clinically. 

I genuinely hope this information is useful and again am happy to answer any questions that might pop up! All the best with it going forward.

Moderna announces first participant dosed in phase 1 study of its mRNA Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) vaccine.

Moderna expects to enrol approximately 270 participants in the U.S.

EBV is a major cause of infectious mononucleosis, which can debilitate patients for weeks to months; there is no approved vaccine to prevent EBV

EBV can also lead to lifelong medical conditions and is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis, certain lymphoproliferative disorders, cancers, and autoimmune diseases.



**Prof. Giovannoni:**

*After reviewing the epidemiological data about the association between EBV and MS in the late nineties I become convinced that EBV is the cause of MS. One of the reasons why I moved academic institutions, from UCL to Queen Mary University of London, was to study EBV and to develop an MS prevention research programme. Despite being very positive I found that it was difficult to convince my colleagues and the wider MS community to invest in EBV-MS research. I was fortunate enough to get an MRC grant application, but since then I must have had at least 20 grant applications around the EBV-MS hypothesis rejected. It is very disheartening when this happens.*

*The good news is that in 2017 Professor Nick Wald, Director of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, suddenly realised that the evidence I had presented to him in 2007 was stronger than he had appreciated and agreed with me that EBV was the likely cause of MS. This lead us to hold a workshop on EBV and MS and led to a successful grant application to the Barts Charity to start the Preventive Neurology Unit (PNU).*

***I am often asked why has no MS preventative action been taken? I need to remind people that science moves steadily and slowly and the biggest problem we have is the slow adoption, or rejection, of innovations or new ideas.***

*However, we are pushing on slowly with our plans to create a trial-ready cohort of people at high risk of MS for exploratory MS prevention studies. Dr Ruth Dobson is doing an amazing job at getting this off the ground. We are also taking forward our ideas around treating MS with antivirals that target EBV. To say that the funding for doing these trials has been difficult is an understatement, but I am hoping if we can get pilot data we can convince the sceptics to fund larger more definitive trials.*

*I cant tell how excited I am that Modernas EBV vaccine has entered phase 1 trials and they have openly acknowledged that if it gets to the general public the vaccine may prevent MS. This statement alone is momentous. Why? If we can convince pharma of the importance of the EBV hypothesis maybe we can now convince funders to support a large international MS prevention study.*

*Even if Moderna proves that their EBV vaccine is effective in preventing EBV infection and infectious mononucleosis we will still have to overcome the public resistance to vaccination and convince public health officials that using EBV vaccination to prevent MS is a worthy objective. The battles ahead are numerous, but we will get there in the end. We have to. We dont want the next generation of pwMS asking us why we havent done anything to prevent MS given the current state of knowledge.*

","[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":223,""label"":""population"",""startOffset"":205}]}}]","RESEARCH: Longitudinal, 20-year Study, Shows EBV May Trigger MS
For decades, researchers have suspected that people infected with an exceedingly common virus, Epstein-Barr, might be more likely to develop multiple sclerosis, a neurological illness that affects a million people in the United States. Now, a team of researchers reports what some say is the most compelling evidence yet of a strong link between the two diseases.

The virus infects nearly everyone in their teen or young adult years, and very few go on to develop multiple sclerosis. **The researchers also note that it is not the only known risk factor for people who develop the illness. But they say their data points to it being the clearest of them all.** While it remains to be seen whether the finding will result in treatments or cures for multiple sclerosis, the study may further motivate research into therapies and vaccines for the condition.

In their [*study*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222), published Thursday in Science, the group examined data from 10 million people on active duty in the United States Armed Forces over two decades. The strength of their study, said its principal investigator, Dr. Alberto Ascherio, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, is that they were able to follow people for years and ask whether infections with Epstein-Barr preceded multiple sclerosis.

Among the service members in the study, 801 developed multiple sclerosis.

At the same time, the virus in question, Epstein-Barr, is common, infecting nearly everyone in the population at some point. Although few are aware that they were infected, some develop mononucleosis. The virus remains in the body for life.

**Because so few who are infected with the virus get multiple sclerosis, it cannot be the sole cause of the disease. Other risk factors have been identified, including some, like low levels of vitamin D and smoking, that were seen previously by the Harvard group using the same data set. There also are genetic factors  900 abnormal genes have been identified in patients with multiple sclerosis, said Dr. Anthony J. Reder, a multiple sclerosis expert at the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the new study. Gender also plays a role; most patients are women.**

But, Dr. Ascherio said, *no risk factor stands out like Epstein-Barr infections.*

**To ask how much the virus increases risk, the investigators studied the small proportion of people who were not infected with the virus early in their service careers but subsequently became infected. They detected infections by the presence of antibodies to the virus.**

**Among the multiple sclerosis patients, 32 out of 33 got infected with Epstein-Barr before they developed M.S.**

As a control group for their study, the scientists tracked 90 individuals who were not initially infected with Epstein-Barr and who also did not get multiple sclerosis. **Of them, just 51 subsequently became infected with Epstein-Barr. That meant an Epstein-Barr virus infection increased the risk of multiple sclerosis over thirtyfold, Dr. Ascherio said.**

But Dr. Reder cautioned that it could be hard to tease out cause and effect from an epidemiological study. People who develop multiple sclerosis have overactive immune systems that make them develop high levels of antibodies to viral infections. Multiple sclerosis might arise not because of the virus but because of the bodys response to it.

*Multiple sclerosis patients have fewer viral infections than normal, he said, because their immune systems are so active that they effectively fight off viruses. Multiple sclerosis patients often say, I never get a cold. When I hear that, my ears perk up.*

So far, he added, anti-viral drugs have not helped patients with multiple sclerosis.

The Harvard group tried to control for the possibility that the immune systems response, not the virus itself, increases the risk of multiple sclerosis in those infected with Epstein-Barr. They asked if antibodies to another common virus, cytomegalovirus, also were linked to a greater risk of multiple sclerosis. They were not.

But cytomegalovirus, Dr. Reder said, for unknown reasons, seems to protect against multiple sclerosis. So the fact that those infected with it did not have a higher risk of multiple sclerosis might not be surprising.

Others said the study was convincing evidence of cause and effect.

*The way it was done is quite compelling, said Dr. Michael Davin Kornberg, a multiple sclerosis specialist at Johns Hopkins. It really is the most convincing data weve had for a causal association.*

Dr. Bruce Cree, a multiple sclerosis researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, noted that it might be difficult to treat multiple sclerosis by going after Epstein-Barr because it can be difficult to find the actual virus in patients. Even though multiple sclerosis is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, he could not find the virus in patients spinal fluid.

But patients do seem to harbor cells in their brains that produce antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus. Dr. Cree is researching whether he can treat multiple sclerosis patients by eradicating those cells, which are infected with Epstein-Barr.

And Dr. Lawrence Steinman, a multiple sclerosis researcher at Stanford, who wrote a perspective accompanying the Harvard groups paper, said an experimental mRNA vaccine against Epstein-Barr was one of a number of approaches being designed to stop the virus from affecting the brain.

The question now, he said, is, ***Can we make multiple sclerosis go away?***

I feel my 2 year costo battle is shifting from right side to left side. From sternum to neck and upperback. My entire upperbody hurts. But lately my throat muscles, jaw muscles are very tight. I can't say they hurt but the tightness is so uncomfy. Ive seen an orthopedic surgeon lately and he did a bonescan and told me I don't have costo cause he can't see any inflammation. Which is just bs cause I feel my sternum and upper chest is inflamed. So he has made me very insecure. He says it might be fybromyalgia. But I saw a rheumatologist last year and he did some blood work and never mentioned fybromyalgia. He just said you don't have rheumatoid artritis or anything related.

So now in stuck with doctors telling me it's prob stress. But it's not. I do get stressed because I feel tight and inflamed all the time. But I don't have any stress at the moment. Not financially, not family related, not work related. Life is actually going OK. I've had surgery for severe endometriosis and I do feel better. More energy. But costo wise I'm not better at all.

My neck, shoulders, rhomboids.. Its just all painful or inflamed. But it has shifted mostly to my throat and frontal neck. I've noticed only a oxazepam helps. Ibuprofen does nothing. A muscle relaxer does help. But hell I can't take those for the rest of my life!

I also have it at its worst when I've slept crappy and moved around a lot in my bed. I somehow also think it's my pillow or bed that's making things worse. The frontal throat muscle tightness is causing me shortness of breath. Everything pulls. Like I've had a neck lift that went wrong. And it pulls the skin of my sternum and breathing becomes difficult.

It sounded a bit weird to me. So again, I googled it. And yes I found that throwing up can get this nerve to act out. I also have epilepsy, so already a sensitive nervous system. I wonder.

I suffered severe panic attacks after the general anesthesia. Had no control whatsoever. She mentioned this is all vagus nerve related.
The vagus nerve regulates breathing, diaphragm, and influences chest, ears, neckproblems. I had no idea.
It also affects inflammation and a healthy gut.

I've decided to try some excersises online that stimulate vagus nerve. See how that goes.
I will also get tmj treatment in February. Wondering if I have jaw problems that make this worse.

I had just gotten my wisdom tooth removed yesterday and prior to that I was on antibiotics for about 2 weeks. I was having severe pain and discomfort prior to the tooth being removed(massive cavity/decay on that wisdom boy).

My concern comes from seeing those abnormal results, primarily in those fields(everything else was normal and in the green). Has anyone encountered abnormal blood results after being on Ocrevus? Or even after being on antibiotics while on Ocrevus?

I know theres always an increased risk of cancer when dealing certain medications, and that a high WBC is an indicator of such.

If you're wondering which sections to get, go for the neck area and thoracic region. These are two separate tests done at once but they will help find the core issue. Usually the worst herniations are found in the neck area.

(This is a throwaway account as I deleted my reddit app to stay off of it and forgot my log in lol) 

Anyway, I have a question, I got diagnosed with ibs 
- mixed a month or so ago after years of suffering (finally got the dumbest answer to all of my shit problems) anyway, I keep thinking I might have a partial bowel obstruction and its causing a great deal of anxiety. The reason I got diagnosed is cos since before Christmas Ive had severe tenesmus, diarrhoea and alternating constipation, gas, cramps, bloated ness the works hoenstly!! Now this has been going on for 3 months obviously, it has gotten better, and I actually went about a week with normal poops and no pain! (It was amazing) but then it came back, usually starts with a flare of diarrhoea, then back to constipation for days, I can still go when Im constipated, but it hurts, sometimes its very little but often, its really mixed and Im just worried. I get super gassy, and stomach makes heaps of noises, sometimes I get nausea which isnt uncommon with my anxiety ect, please can someone tell me how Id know if I had a bowel obstruction. I visited the doc twice last month and just got told I probably have ibs, that is all, and it was great to hear after years of pain and on and off suffering, but now its been 3 months of constant suffering, worrying and all the rest and Im so over it! It honestly feels like when Im pooping and stuff is coming out that there is more in there all the time. I have read and heard a partial bowel obstruction would cause vomiting, and severe nausea and a lot more pain! And probably no passing of gas or stool! Im really really scared honestly, can anyone give me some reference as to how they felt with it? Would I be in more pain ect?

Two different doctors did feel my stomach and everything too! Surely they would be able to feel it?"

Please read the book IBS A New Solution by Dr. Pimental. He explains everything Im about to say and in further detail based on scientific research.

I feel I wouldnt be doing my do-diligence if I didnt speak up on this topic. I was diagnosed with IBS 6 years ago but in my heart felt there was something else going on. I felt the symptoms I was experiencing were way too extreme and my so called IBS was disrupting my life at more of a level than some people I knew with IBS. I was finally diagnosed with Sibo 4 months ago. If you suspect there may be something else wrong with you please look into this!! Most doctors dont know a ton on this topic(including GI DRs) and its a strange breath test to detect. For anyone who believes they just have IBS, please disregard this message. Not trying to cause worry, just want to help if I can. If I can help change one persons life - thats enough. Let me know if you have any questions.

Edit: If you test for Sibo you have to test for all 3 types - Methane Sibo, Hydrogen Sibo, and Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo. The doctors normally only tests for Methane Sibo and Hydrogen Sibo and there is a chance your results will come up negative although you have it. This could be an inconclusive test. The reason for this is that Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo is more dominant and it competes with Methane Sibo to eat Hydrogen Sibo. When the Hydrogen Sibo is gone(all eaten) the Methane Sibo dies off leaving your results for both at 0, but you could still very well have Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo and you wouldnt know it and your DR wouldnt know it. There is a test called Trio smart breath at home test kit that tests for all 3. Order it online and get your doctor to sign off on it if you can. This is really only a concern for anyone who tests at a 0 for Methane and Hydrogen. I tested positive for both but I still need to test for Sulfide Sibo as the protocol for treating this kind is totally different than treating Methane and Hydrogen and is its own kind of beast. If you find you have Sibo get yourself a good intestinal Naturopathic Dr. to help guide you through.

Also, Sibo can cause Sifo (Fungal overgrowth) which can be tested for through a specific Endoscopy that tests for a fungus overgrowth. If you have this as well, you need to treat both. If you do not get rid of the fungus - you cant get rid of the Sibo. Fungus and bacteria compete for a hospitable living environment in your intestinal tract and this causes the bacteria to grow stronger and multiply."

Hello!  Im a guy with MS who has previously had low testosterone numbers pre-dx (eg below 12 nmol/L).  Ive been feeling especially crappy lately (low energy stuff).  So rather than just accept its MS, I dove into the rabbit hole of trying to find why I feel crappy and came across something interesting that may affect others in here.

Since my dx, Ive been taking supplements to help control my MS.  And my regime and DMT have worked.  My MS went from highly active at dx to NEDA now.  One thing I do every day is I take a flax seed oil + curcumin capsule.

Flax seed oil reduces relapses by 60% according to this study by Dr Jelinik (of OMS diet):

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3821380/

Awesome.  I am only taking 1x1000mg capsule daily- not a lot.  However, apparently when taking with curcumin + piperine, absorption is increased.  

Now, back to me feeling crappy.  I went to an endocrinologist, described symptoms I was having, and she sent me for a blood panel.  It came back with a ridiculously high testosterone number.  Like almost 30 nmol/L - an unnatural number for my age and totally inconsistent with my prior panel.  I should be rocking a massive erection constantly.  But instead, its barely even just okay.  Likewise with body hair, I dont have very much.  And Im hardly very muscular either.  Somethings not right with that number.

So I started reading and found an association between flax seed oil and testosterone that fit:

The reason that flaxseeds are on the hit list for raising testosterone is because they are rich in lignans, which tend to mimic estrogen in the body. Since estrogen is the opposing sex hormone to testosterone, the more of it you have (particularly if you are a man), the more low testosterone-like symptoms youll have. (from: https://www.shawacademy.com/blog/6-foods-to-avoid-to-optimise-natural-testosterone/ )

Also its discussed at length in setting of PCOS at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752973/

Whats interesting is, testosterone is associated with a neuroprotective effect in MS.  (from: https://www.mdedge.com/multiplesclerosishub/article/134428/multiple-sclerosis/testosterone-affects-outcomes-men-ms ).

The effect of estrogen-mimicking lignans fits as a culprit for feeling crappy in a hypogonadism sense - but it also seems to fit the unexplained data from Dr Jeliniks study showing how much more effective flax seed oil was compared to other Omega-3s, since lignans are a unique element not found in fish oils.

If only that Omega-3 study had an endocrine panel, this theory might be solved.  It seems like tapering down flax seed oil intake would help me feel better- but could also reduce beneficial effect of the high testosterone on my MS.

Not sure which path to take.  But an interesting set of associations!  If any smart person has any guidance or this is all wrong, would be helpful!"

Hi,

I am having bad reaction on Plegridy (red big patches that itch long after injection was administered). It has been few months and it hasn't gotten better. I didn't have this on Betaseron, and since both are interferon I compared the additives in these injection to find the culprit.

What **Plegridy** injections have extra apart from **Betaferon (Betaseron)**  is

*L-*[*arginine*](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7006) *HCl* 

[*sodium acetate*](https://www.rxlist.com/sodium-acetate-drug.htm) *trihydrate*

*glacial* [*acetic acid*](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32085) \- this I found is strong skin and mucus membrane irritant

*polysorbate 20* \- possible allergen

**And Kesimpta has**

 *e L-arginine*

 *sodium acetate trihydrate*

*polysorbate 80* \- possible alergen

*disodium edetate dihydrate*

 *hydrochloric acid* 

So, I am hoping that the problematic ingredients giving me itchy red patches that don't fade is the glacial acetic acid which is NOT in Kesimpta. But it could also be the polysorbate, which is in both. By my own deduction, the irritating ingredient is the one which purpose it is to make the drug release gradually. Because it gets worse after 7-10th day after injection.

I am afradit I will fight for this drug and end up with the same reactions. My doctor told me I am THE ONLY ONE of his patients having local site reactions to Plegridy. Which is strange, because he said he has many patients on Plegridy and I found that according to leaflet 66% of patients have it. And only around 11% have local site reactions to Kesimpta, which is hopeful to me

I will appreciate any thoughts - reassurance from those who don't local site reaction, or replies from those who do have, or any experience going from interferon to Kesimpta.

My doctor is not of much help with this, they just suggested K-vitamin cream, which does nothing, because my skin is irritated and not bruised. They see a bruise and think it is a bruise. What helps a little bit are antihistamine cream and pills, but I don't want to take the pill every day and it doesn't help that much.

Today I wanted to talk about something that people usually dont mention a lot.

I started to have dissociation episodes sense I was 14 years old (now Im 21) and got diagnosed psychosis at 15 years old.

There was a period of time that I use to dissociate almost everyday but my therapist never looked into it that much.

A couple of weeks ago my put me on Seroquel, that helped me a lot with sleep and my hallucinations.

I just switched to a new psychiatrist because my  old one was full of red flags.
When I told her about my dissociation episodes she told me that is was from psychosis and a way to protect me from my traumas.

So this is interesting because I also read researchers online that explain that dissociation can be also another symptom of psychosis.

I found myself venting to my journal and thought I'd share. If you're feeling this way, you're not alone.

&#x200B;

I know that Im not supposed to let MS take my joy like its taken so much else, but here I am. The frustrating thing is that the change is so slight to outsiders, even to me. But the changes are still there. Its this constant cloud hanging over me, like how every time I wake up and feel a scratch in the back of my throat I remember that even though I got a positive COVID test back three weeks ago, my body still hasnt completely recovered because Im immunocompromised. If I feel extra fatigued after a long day, I start rifling through my activities, wondering what could have possibly made my legs so sore, and then I remember that sometimes just going through a day makes me stiff and sore like Id done a rigorous exercise. That swallowing thing is a real bitch, too. People dont realize how alarming it is to expect your throat to just do what it always does and send the food back and down your gullet only for there to be no motion, and for the act of swallowing to become mechanical, like writing out specific instructions to your throat on how to do its job. But really, its not about the swallowing, or the night sweats, or being constantly sick, or the tingling and the numbness, or the fatigue. Its about the degeneration. Its about the fact that every time I show a symptom, Im reminded that my body has attacked that delicate myelin sheath around my nerves and that that process will continue, even if its slowed down by Ocrevus. How am I supposed to ever be okay with that?

Mom said that someday the treatments wont be so hard on me emotionally. She says it to make me feel better because she doesnt like to see anyone in pain. It doesnt help.

And the most difficult part of this whole thing is that nothing helps. Truly. Im beyond grateful for my doctors and the treatments and everything, but Im so sick of what all these people do to try to make me feel better about it. The constant flow of, its such a different disease, and but youll still have a future, and at least they caught it early sometimes makes me just want to scream. All of thats true, and I know its true. But pretty please, dont fucking tell me that again because its what I repeat to myself over and over and over again every time I feel myself starting to feel angry or upset about the disease. I promise, Ive heard it before. I promise, none of it takes away the disease. It increases the shame and guilt over my refusal to take it lightly."

Sorry but I've recently been walking everyday for my arthritis and fibro, and noticed when I sit down and chill after, I get a tight and weak chest and my back and chest and ribs ache (basically my whole body aches) and I get tired and slightly dizzy. I have tachycardia and take two beta blockers in the morning and again at night.

Me: Loses feeling in right arm.
Sorry for the ridiculous title, but that's basically what's happened.

Here's my old post for context
https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/pz4q4o/no_treatment/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share 

3 months ago the Dr told me I didn't need treatment unless I was having frequent relapses. After getting advice from you guys I called the hospital I'm at and spoke to a nurse about getting treatment, because that seemed wrong. It was a no from her as well. 

So I thought I'd wait it out for 3 months until I get to my appointment with the neuro next week. Where I'd push for treatment (as would my partner) - and if it was still a no then I'd find a new Dr. 

So what happened 3 days ago? I lost feeling in my right arm 

Still hasn't come back, and now it feels like it's full of freezing cold water which is horribly uncomfortable. The sensation of temperature in my arm is so messed up, hot things feel vaguely warm and anything slightly cold feels painfully cold - like a block of ice. 

I am currently awake at 2am because its just so uncomfortable. 

So right now I don't know whether to laugh or cry. I'm absolutely furious that this has been allowed to happen and I'm scared about how long I'll be dealing with this horrible feeling. But there's also a part of me that finds it slightly funny... Is that crazy? I mean, I work on a computer all day and I can't even feel the keys??

I'm genuinely anticipating going into my appointment and having him say I'm totally fine/it's anxiety/I don't need treatment/deal with it etc. In which case I'll hit him with my stick and find someone new. 

Anyway, just wanted to vent. I only got diagnosed 6 months ago and I am already absolutely fucking done with this illness and fucking done trying to fight for every scrap of support. (Oh- still haven't had a single physio session after losing feeling from the chest down 6 months ago, and have taught myself to walk again- slowly and painfully, after leaving the hospital with nothing and buying my mobility aids from Amazon)

Ps- I'm in the UK if that's at all relevant. I've been told you have to meet quite strict criteria to be eligible for treatment, which as of yet, I apparently haven't.

UPDATE-
Gone to the walk in centre to get steroids because I can't feel my arm. They told me that if it's just sensory I need to deal with it and they aren't going to give me any treatment.

Apparently not being able to feel my dominant arm is a non issue.

I give up."

Although these are not my symptoms. I was wondering why and how do people experience shortness of breath and crushing chest pain with costochondritis? I do not doubt the symptoms and what you all feel. 

I guess what I am trying to ask with the definitions that Drs and experts have given. Crushing chest pain seems really severe and outside the realms of the inflammation of the rib cartilage at the sternum. And the shortness of breath would be something pulmonary if it is literally stopping you from breathing.

However I do understand that the pain can make it hard to take a full deep breath ( what I feel) when you exhale or inhale. Or our good old friend anxiety can cause the feeling like you have shortness of breath.

None of these are reproducible  or are they ? ( the crushing chest pain and feeling like you cant breathe). People and doctors really emphasize that when gettting diagnosed, that pains are reproducible. But are they?"

About 11 weeks into my pregnancy I started experiencing tingling/numbness on my left side and went into the doctor, thinking it was pregnancy related. They sent me to the ER to have imaging done, where they found lesions in my brain. I had a lumbar puncture done that confirmed an MS diagnosis, as well as additional MRIs on my spine that were inconclusive because they can't use contrast when you're pregnant.

My neurologist recommended I start Copaxone, but my OB doesn't want me to start it during pregnancy so I am holding off for now (with neurologist's okay).

My flare ups have been manageable and the pain is limited. I'm actually flare up free currently (finally) which gives me hope that it is subsiding the more pregnant I get (currently 24 weeks).

I kind of just needed to vent, because adjusting to this diagnosis has been hard. There is so much uncertainty ahead and that scares me. 

I also wanted to ask if anyone has had experience breastfeeding while on Copaxone. I had planned on starting it after delivery, but my OB posed the question of if it's safe to take while breastfeeding (which I hadn't even thought about). I am waiting for my referral to an MS specialist, but I know there isn't a lot of research on the topic. Did anyone breastfeed on Copaxone? 

I'm also nervous about future pregnancies. This is our first and my husband and I want three kids, but now I'm not sure what is feasible - i.e. going off of MS meds if/when I try to get pregnant, what that might do to my body. I know my specialist will be able to ease some of these questions, but they have been weighing so heavily on me I wanted to see if anyone here has experience with this. I also know it's different for everyone, especially because I don't know what my body will be like/be capable of after pregnancy.

\- Several cardio checkups - all normal (there is one thing called cardiovascular spasm that can potentially be linked but a provocation test is needed to rule that out)  
\- Several meetings with the gastroenterologist - Diagnosed with GERD and hiatal hernia - 2 years under Ezomeprasole - little effect. Doctors said maybe is sensitive esophagus, but I see little connection  between what I eat and the symptoms. 

One doctor suggested it might be stress related so I did one year of therapy with a psychologist with little effect. 

Long story short, all doctors say it might be hear or stomach or stress, and all also agree that they dont have enough evidence to link it to hear or stomach or stress. 

Fast forward to today, during a casual checkup one doctor said: Have you considered it might be tietze's syndrome, especially since it is somewhat painful when I touch at the joints between the ribs and the sternum (breastbone). 

To those who have been diagnosed with tietze's syndrome, do you recognize my symptoms?"

 A research team led by Dr. Marcus Koch and Dr. Wee Yong (Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of AnthoBio) at the University of Calgary that investigates a generic drug, hydroxychloroquine, in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) recently published its clinical study results in Annals of Neurology. The study followed 35 PPMS patients over a period of five years. Throughout the study, 14 patients were expected to develop a significant reduction in their walking function. However, only 8 patients had experienced a reduction by the end of the study. Thats almost a 50% reduction in the number of PPMS patients negatively affected by continuing disability. Although the results will require confirmation in a larger trial, this study has shown that hydroxychloroquine could help slow down the disability progression of PPMS. This study opens the possibility for future treatment option for PPMS and the researchers hope their work will inspire future larger scale clinical research on the drug for PPMS.

I've had IBS-D for quite a few years.

Hi everyone. My friends ex-boyfriend suffered a major psychotic break and has been in and out of mental health clinics since last year. He has had violent delusions, mostly focusing on his parents, who he has accused of stealing his organs and kidnapping him and all sorts of other things, and hes expressed desire to kill his parents. My friend says that she truly believes that if hed cast her as the villain instead of his parents, shed be dead. 

She moved into a new apartment with me and another friend. According to her, he doesnt know where she lives now, and she doesnt think he has a way of finding out. Ever since his symptoms started hes been aggressive and prone to displays of violence in front of her. She has him blocked but she can still see his texts to her on her other devices since her contacts didnt update. He recently accused her of coercing him into sex their entire decade-long relationship, and now shes really scared he is going to start fixating on her. She says he has really bad follow-through (he hasnt killed his parents, obviously) and it seems like a lot of tasks are harder for him, like she had to hire a doctor to help him sell his house because she didnt think hed be able to in his current state of mind. 

She says that violent delusions are usually uncommon in people with psychosis and/or schizophrenia, and that hes in the marginal percent that unfortunately does experience this. 

I am trying to be a good friend and be sympathetic, but Im worried, too. What are the chances that hell find our apartment? Or that hell come over here and try to hurt us? He doesnt have the address, but its easy for anyone to find an address if they put their mind to it. He has guns. If he planned it all out, he could find us easily. Im just wondering if you folks with experience feeling something similar to what hes feeling know if thats the sort of thing someone suffering from a psychotic episode would be able to carry out. 

He has not respected my friends boundaries in the past or her request for him not to contact her. 

I dont experience psychosis myself, so I dont know what its like. Im hoping you folks might be able to offer me some insight into what this guy might be experiencing when he has these paranoid, violent delusions, and whether my friend and I need to be scared for our safety here.

Before he started getting violent and aggressive, he was my friend, too. I feel really bad for him. Whatever hes going through must be terrifying for him. But my first concern is if I need to be afraid OF him. If hes in the headspace to track us down and do something violent. Any advice or insight is helpful. Thank you."

Hi,

I am having bad reaction on Plegridy (red big patches that itch long after injection was administered). It has been few months and it hasn't gotten better. I didn't have this on Betaseron, and since both are interferon I compared the additives in these injection to find the culprit.

What **Plegridy** injections have extra apart from **Betaferon (Betaseron)**  is

*L-*[*arginine*](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=7006) *HCl* 

[*sodium acetate*](https://www.rxlist.com/sodium-acetate-drug.htm) *trihydrate*

*glacial* [*acetic acid*](https://www.rxlist.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=32085) \- this I found is strong skin and mucus membrane irritant

*polysorbate 20* \- possible allergen

**And Kesimpta has**

 *e L-arginine*

 *sodium acetate trihydrate*

*polysorbate 80* \- possible alergen

*disodium edetate dihydrate*

 *hydrochloric acid* 

So, I am hoping that the problematic ingredients giving me itchy red patches that don't fade is the glacial acetic acid which is NOT in Kesimpta. But it could also be the polysorbate, which is in both. By my own deduction, the irritating ingredient is the one which purpose it is to make the drug release gradually. Because it gets worse after 7-10th day after injection.

I am afradit I will fight for this drug and end up with the same reactions. My doctor told me I am THE ONLY ONE of his patients having local site reactions to Plegridy. Which is strange, because he said he has many patients on Plegridy and I found that according to leaflet 66% of patients have it. And only around 11% have local site reactions to Kesimpta, which is hopeful to me

I will appreciate any thoughts - reassurance from those who don't local site reaction, or replies from those who do have, or any experience going from interferon to Kesimpta.

My doctor is not of much help with this, they just suggested K-vitamin cream, which does nothing, because my skin is irritated and not bruised. They see a bruise and think it is a bruise. What helps a little bit are antihistamine cream and pills, but I don't want to take the pill every day and it doesn't help that much.

Anyway, Ive been in a lot of posts lately about constipation. Heres the thing: if you have IBS-C but havent had motility testing, you definitely need it. 

You could have full or partial bowel dysmotility and it be the cause of your problems. This is especially true if you dont respond to dietary changes (very high fibre) or medication (especially prescriptions). 

You need to get tested for colonic inertia (this is key). It is the first in line. There are tests to check your stomach for slow emptying (Gastroparesis), small bowel dysmotility, pelvic floor and rectal issues, as well. All of these should be in a regular work up. 

If your GI doesnt do it, you should go to a motility clinic. There are numerous but not abundant. Most teaching hospitals have one and there are directories online. You should also seek out a neurogastroenterologist.

If you have any questions about this, colonic inertia, bowel dysmotility, or my own experience, please post them here and Ill answer them all. 

There are ways to help it, but you have to know what youre treating first!

If you want to share your predicament, I can offer proper advice on the next steps to take."

Psychosis/ptsd? Drug induced
Hello. First of all thank you for taking the time to read my post, I ve found this sub very helpful full of knowledgeable people.

Here is my story, Im hoping someone can help me understand a little better what happened to me

 I started drinking alcohol at 15, smoking weed at 16, I got paranoia from it but did not quit as I was kind of self medicating for teenage depression and my friends did it too. Did other party drugs during this time but dont think these were a major issue.
Then at 19 I started using LSD. The second trip was truly traumatic, for almost 3 years I had flashbacks to another unsettling reality, some things Id see in the street, or topics of conversation, or even taste would trigger it. I would get stuck in very distorted mental state
I also had really bad anxiety (felt like I couldnt beat her 24/7 for months and years at a time) and other issues like cyclical obsessions with certain topics, I thought I was going crazy sometimes.

As a response to my mental state I quit all drugs and started to try taking care of myself properly. 

The distortions and such happen a lot less now (Im 26 atm) but I still get pretty bad paranoia and parallel reality from time to time, last time it happened on a hangover after having sex with a friend - it was triggered by looking at trees (this was a main trigger from the lsd flashbacks) but I think I also have some sexual trauma thats playing into this, because I am more prone to experience these episodes after having sex with men.

Could someone tell me if what I ve experienced is more related to ptsd, to psychosis, both, none? I think it would help me labelling it. Any other comments welcome too.

I also think I have adhd, Im trying to get help for this now.

Hi. I think I have this condition because a Physiotherapist and a General Practitioner suspected it. Some website online suggests I should see a Rheumatologist. My physiotherapist said you need to see your GP. My GP says take Diclofenac Potassium 50mg (Voltaren pills)

No one knows a thing. Everyone knows jackshit. It happened 6 months ago randomly. I actually hurt a muscle in my chest while working as a labourer, but the pain went away in about 2 weeks. It came back about a month later. It actually doesnt hurt the same, that was my chest muscle, this is my sternum. It could not even be related to that. I have stopped lifting anything heavier than a milk bottle and started sleeping like Im on my deathbed and it still didnt make it go away.

All Rheumatologists in Sydney (Australia) are booked for the next 8 weeks! What the hell!!!

I read peoples posts and some claim CBD Oil worked for them. This thing apparently got legalised here in 2016, hopefully its something good. Ill tell my GP about it. Or should I stay on the Voltaren pills for a week maybe? What the hell should I do and where should I go? The specialists are booked out and 2 of the GPs I went to kept saying Give it time, avoid exercising Yeah, Ive been doing that for months. Other people are saying Voltaren and ibuprofen. Im on 2 Voltarens a day right now.

I wanna learn Lacrosse and try Jiu Jitsu and get back to lifting to focus on my life and I just cant. Im not even motivated to meet people and have fun because Im so worried about my pain. It hurts when Im in a position where there is pressure on my chest, when I go down, when I jump, forget doing push ups or sit ups. I dont wanna get fat. I actually lost all the gains I made in the gym in the past year Fuck.

I currently trust my Physiotherapist the most. The guy actually seems to care and Ive been seeing him every 3 days (Booked 5 sessions) and Ive been extra careful with my chest. He found which rib is hurting (Its on the right side). He also told me to do Snow angels and Butterflies.

My Physiotherapist also thinks I should see a specialist, while the GP only prescribed Voltaren pills and the other GP ignored my concern altogether. Didnt even care about my pain. Fuckin dickhead.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Does anyone have a remedy to this? I am growing impatient as its been 6 months and all GPs and physiotherapists say is Go here, go there. Give it time, try anti-inflammatory pills. See a specialist.. Maybe someone here knows something? Theyre literally clueless and I feel like theyre just trying to make money off me."

","[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[{""endOffset"":199,""label"":""intervention"",""startOffset"":185},{""endOffset"":241,""label"":""outcome"",""startOffset"":200}]}}]","NEW Study Explains How Epstein-Barr Virus Infection Could Cause/Trigger MS
**Similarities between an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein and a brain protein called GlialCAM may explain why EBV infection increases the risk of multiple sclerosis (MS), results from a new study show.**

**Due to the structural resemblance of the two proteins, B-cells  a type of immune cell that is critical to the development of MS  might accidentally end up attacking a persons own healthy tissue while trying to fight off EBV.**

The findings begin to unravel the molecular mechanisms behind the long-known association between EBV infection and MS and may pave the way to the development of novel therapies for the neurodegenerative disease.

Results were published in Nature in the study  which was made available early due to the importance of the research.[Clonally Expanded B Cells in Multiple Sclerosis Bind EBV EBNA1 and GlialCAM,](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04432-7) which was made available early due to the importance of the research.



Epstein-Barr virus infects most people at some point in their lives. Most of the time, EBV infections dont cause noteworthy symptoms, though the virus can cause infectious mononucleosis (colloquially known as mono).

An accumulating body of research has shown a connection between EBV infection and MS. Most recently, a study of more than 10 million U.S. military members showed that infection with EBV increased the risk of developing MS by more than 30 times, placing EBV as the leading cause of MS.

*EBV may be the only risk factor required to develop MS, given essentially 100 percent of people living with MS have been infected with EBV, Lawrence Steinman, MD, a professor at Stanford University and co-author of the study, said in a press release.*

Despite this known connection, it was unclear what series of biochemical events could lead from EBV to MS.

**The new study shows that this connection may lie in immune cells called B-cells, which are best known for producing infection-fighting antibodies. A given antibody is able to bind tightly to a specific molecular target  called an antigen, which may be, for example, a piece of a virus  which triggers the immune system to attack.**

B-cells basically float around the body with antibodies primed on their surface. If their antibody binds to its antigen, the B-cell becomes activated, rapidly dividing and spewing out pro-inflammatory signaling molecules to sound the alarm to the rest of the immune system.

As an activated B-cell divides to produce more cells, the cells undergo a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM). Basically, this involves making small changes to the antibody structure that aim to increase the antibodys ability to stick to its specific antigen.



Here, scientists analyzed B-cells collected from nine patients  five with a first onset of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and four with a relapse of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). From analyses of thousands of B-cells, the researchers showed evidence that many of these cells were behaving as though they were attacking an antigen.

The team then selected 148 unique B-cells from the cerebrospinal fluid (the liquid surrounding the brain and spinal cord) for further analysis, looking at the antigens that these B-cells antibodies were targeting. The team noted that six of the nine patients had B-cells that targeted an EBV protein called EBNA1, and they performed detailed structural analyses of a particular antibody, called mAb MS39p2w174, that bound to a particular region of EBNA1 referred to as AA365-425.

The scientists then noticed that the AA365-425 region of the EBNA1 protein is structurally quite similar to a part of a human protein called GlialCAM. The GlialCAM protein is expressed by certain cells in the brain, including notably oligodendrocytes  the cells chiefly responsible for producing myelin, the fatty sheath around nerve fibers that is the target of the autoimmune attack in MS.

From all these data, the researchers constructed a conceptual model for how EBV might spur the development of MS.

**First, patrolling B-cells would come in contact with the infecting virus, and some B-cells with antibodies that target the EBNA1 protein would become activated. In the course of activating, these cells undergo SHM, which could inadvertently increase the antibodys ability to target GlialCAM.**

**The antibodies then bind to GlialCAM that is expressed by healthy cells in the nervous system, which triggers the immune system to attack  ultimately leading to the development of an autoimmune disease.**

***Until now, we didnt have a step-by-step account of how this drives the immune system to attack a persons own myelin sheath. This new research fills in those gaps and provides clarity into how EBV infection can cause MS, Steinman said.***

The results imply that targeting EBV infections might be a useful strategy for treating MS  and indeed, Steinman noted, this idea is already being explored. For example, Atara Biotherapeutics is sponsoring a Phase 2 clinical trial called EMBOLD (NCT03283826) to test ATA188, an experimental therapy that aims to kill EBV-infected cells in progressive forms of MS.

***These new data further link MS to EBV-infected B cells and plasma cells, highlighting the role of EBV antigens, including EBNA1 protein, in the development of the disease, said AJ Joshi, MD, Ataras chief medical officer.***

*Importantly ATA188, Ataras investigational MS therapy, targets key epitopes of these antigens, including EBNA1, with the hope of ultimately delivering a new treatment option for the millions of people currently living with MS, Joshi added. The actively enrolling Phase 2 EMBOLD study, with a formal interim analysis planned for [the second quarter of] this year, will be a major step toward that direction.*

So I posted this in a comment and it was suggested that I make this info its own post. I did a bunch of research into what probiotics have shown to be effective for IBS in various research studies.

From the links below, the collective summary is that these probiotic strains (alone or in combination with others) were effective in one or more studies in reducing one or more IBS symptoms in frequency and/or severity: 

Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745 (actually a yeast), Bifidobacterium longum 35624, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, and Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75.

I may have missed a few in the above list, but the main gist is that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species probiotics, as well as Saccharomyces Boulardii, are the main researched probiotics that show some kind of improvement for IBS (though it also depends on the type of IBS, and most of them helped with one or some symptoms but not all of them - see links below for more detail).

Also, many of the studies couldn't draw conclusive evidence because there just wasn't enough data/research on specific probiotics yet, or because the studies didn't fulfill certain criteria. But they were able to state what evidence they did have, and identify what is likely to be the case based on findings so far.

Bifidobacterium longum 35624 used to be called Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 and is still sometimes referred to that way. It is patented by Align, which is the brand name for that probiotic. Floraster is a leading brand name for Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745. There are other good probiotic brands too though (that have similar or different probiotic strains).

A lot of this will be trial and error as you find what works for you. Be sure to give each probiotic or probiotic blend you try at least a 4 week trial, since it takes a bit of time for your body to adjust and for the probiotics to get to a certain level in your system to start working.

It's a good idea to make sure that the probiotics are third-party tested and made in a GMC (or equivalent) registerred facility, to be sure you are getting exactly what's on the product label. I'm not sure exactly how it works in other countries, and that advice is US-based, but some level of quality assurance is generally advised.

Also, for those who aren't used to reading research papers like this, usually the important information is in the Results and/or Discussion section. Sometimes they put a summary of those near the top, and sometimes you have to scroll to the end of the article. It's also a good idea to read the abstract/summary at the top of the article so you have an idea of what the paper is about. Reading the other sections of the paper will give you more detail into what they did for the study, which will give more context, but isn't usually necessary to read the whole thing to understand the end results, which tell you what they found about the probiotics in relation to IBS.

And of course, always talk to your doctor about medical stuff! I'm just providing this information in case it might be helpful. I am NOT giving medical advice or telling you all to take probiotics or endorsing any brands or types or anything. Whether you decide to take probiotics or not is up to you and your doctor. This is just an info dump in case anyone wanted to know this stuff.

Per my last post:
I (23, F) was born 3 months early, no idea what caused it. I've had lung issues and general health issues my entire life. The older I get, the worse my lungs get and no one seems to be able to tell me why. Tired of getting worse for no reason and feeling like no one took me seriously, I did a little research of my own. A friend of mine with CF had symptoms that closely mirrored what I've dealt with for years. So I got a 23+Me kit for fun to see what kinds of things it could tell me about my health but also my ancestry. Note: I don't know or have any relationship with my dad. So this was very helpful. 

UPDATE from last post:
  I did the 23+Me ancestry and health kit for fun and curiosity. Well... I am a Delta F508 deletion carrier. BUT the 23+Me test noted that it only covered about 30 CFTR genes and recommended that I see a genetic counselor to A. Check that the rest of my CFTR genes are okay since I'm a carrier for one, and B. Understand the risk if I choose to have children. 

OPINION: 
I am really shocked that I am even a carrier. I don't know my dad, but NO one on my mom's side even knew what CF was. So I'm not too worried about anything being wrong with the rest of my CFTR genes, but the fact that now I need to find out is a bit upsetting. As much as I want answers for my lifelong symptoms, I am a little nervous to finally get them. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. 
Also, as someone who has wanted kids for as long as I can remember, I am really saddened that now this is something I need to consider. Regardless of if my future child would have CF.

I am also saddened to think that my future children's suffering would be a result of my bogus DNA. Like, how crappy is that? Knowing that I am a carrier and now have a 25% chance of passing on a df508- gene, does it make me selfish that I still deeply want kids? Is it selfish to knowingly risk it? Do any of you wish your parents hadn't risked it? I dont know... just hearing other's thoughts would be nice. Thanks for listening. And thanks for the support, guys. 

FYI, I am going to talk to my primary about it and am definitely going to see a genetic specialist before having kids. But still, the thought is... ugh."

I was wondering if I could run something by you, guys. Maybe someone is in a similar boat.

I recently got my third Covid vaccine, and like some of you, I have been wondering how effective it has been. I read a study awhile back, that concluded that those of us on Gilenya might not be so fortunate when it comes to antibodies. So, I asked my doctor (not a neuro) should I check mine. She said that the national health bureau (in Finland) doesnt recommend that but she put the request in the system, if I want to go for the blood test.

But is it beneficial? Does it actually matter, if Im already masking and socially distancing? Have you guys checked your antibody - levels and has that actually lead to anything?"

update: didn't end up doing the enema (tried but failed to even insert the tube 1mm), went anyways, explained the situation and ended up going through with the procedure (this is a private clinic, i pay for this out of my pocket anyways so it's not a waste of their time either way). doc told me citrafleet was milder and less effective and I should've went with moviprep instead (wish he would've told me this prior). didn't have time to explain in the post but that's just how shit works in small town eastern europe, no one cares to listen, ask questions and explain stuff to you. the reason i modified the instructions after extensive googling is because they weren't even given to me by the doc, it was a generic, confusing and vague piece of paper given to everyone at the counter (these change depending on which marketing guy visited their office last) he said only way to know if it's good is to try and see and it ended up being clean enough. he said he could tell i was being responsible about it with my diet and everything. i was watching my bowels since i wasnt sedated (uncomfy but not that bad) and there was definitely build up towards the small intestine but he vacuumed it up and the procedure was a success. found nothing other than internal hemorrhoids, told me i had elongated and kinda twisted bowels but other than that it's fine. took 4 biopsies for some micro inflammation test thing. thanks everyone for the help"

If you eat a lot of meat, you may be at increased risk for multiple sclerosis, a new study suggests.

MS is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the insulation around nerves. It's not clear what triggers the attack, but mounting evidence suggests bacteria plays a role. Gut bacteria can affect the immune system, and diet influences gut bacteria.

**To learn more about the interplay of diet, gut bacteria, the immune system and MS, researchers studied 25 MS patients and 24 people without the disease.**

*""We found a number of gut bacteria associated with MS and severity of disability of MS patients,""* said study author Dr. Yanjiao Zhou, an assistant professor of medicine at UConn Health School of Medicine in Farmington, Conn.

*""We also found increased autoimmune markers and signature metabolites in MS. But what is really interesting is how these systems connect with each other, and how diet is involved in these connections,""* Zhou said in a University of Connecticut news release.

***Eating more meat, having lower levels of certain bacteria in the gut, and more of certain immune cells in the blood were all associated with MS, according to the report published online recently in the journal EBioMedicine.***

**Higher meat consumption, which was found in the MS patients, was linked with lower gut levels of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron -- a bacteria involved with digesting carbohydrates from vegetables.**

Higher meat consumption was also related to an increase in T-helper 17 cells in the immune system, and an increase in S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in the blood.

The researchers said the findings suggest that in people with MS, something disconnects their gut bacteria from the immune system, resulting in autoimmune attacks on the nervous system. This sequence tends to be associated with meat-eating, they suggested.

According to study author Dr. Laura Piccio, *""This is the first study using an integrated approach to analyze the interplay between diet, gut microbiome, the immune system and metabolism"" and their contribution to MS development. Piccio is an associate professor of neurology at the University of Sydney who was previously at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.*

The authors want to expand their research to include more people, including patients with a more severe form of MS. The aim is to learn more about the interaction of diet, gut bacteria and the immune system in MS to possibly prevent the disease or ease symptoms.

*As it was explained to me by my doctor, serotonin is used between immune system cells to communicate and activate immune system responses within the body. Taking an ssri altered these responses in me. 


My original diagnosis was based on three things: first, a change in vision. Then an MRI where they found 20-30 lesions, then a lower lumbar puncture to confirm my immune system was attacking me. I was placed on tysabri and given one-two MRIs per year since 2015. However, the head doctor of the largest multiple sclerosis center closest to me was reluctant to diagnosis me until the lumbar puncture because he believed several of my other symptoms were indicative of severe reactions to an ssri I was on, and as I continued to go to them with symptoms, he continued to iterate that. I had several exacerbations over the years and an MRI following each one, and each MRI came back the same with no new lesions. My vision issues actually continued (the exacerbations) despite there being no progress on lesions, and over time it became apparent to me that we were all, including me, overlooking something else- I have terrible eye contact habits and was suffering from inner eye infections so once I began to get treated for those, my vision problems became preventable. It takes years to taper off of the ssri safely, which I did, and its been several years since Ive been on it. It was explained to me that the ssri changed the environment in my stomach which changed the way my immune system responded, causing an immune system disorder but not real autoimmunity. I do have another lower lumbar puncture coming up to confirm my immune system response. Perhaps Im over-excited until then, but being told by doctors that it was because of the ssri and a resulting immune system disorder because it changed the biome in my gut has been eye-opening."

It was terrifying, and Im sure my cortisol levels were astronomical. This afternoon all of my normal POTS symptoms are out of control. Heart rate is 100+ just sitting, air hunger is wild, obviously super dizzy and lightheaded, etc. Its like everything has been turned up several notches, and Im wondering if yall have experienced the same thing. Ive had this same issue many times after similarly scary experiences, and Im curious if its connected to the cortisol/adrenaline.

From everything I have researched, this is a rare mutation and specific to a region that I am from (could be wrong, but there is just not a lot of info I found on this mutation).

After doing a deep dive on Google (which is awful at anytime, but especially when you are pregnant) I found that 1 in 25 caucasians are a carrier for a CF mutation. My husband is going to get tested to see if he is a carrier and then go from there. I am trying to stay positive, but its been hard.

 A research team led by Dr. Marcus Koch and Dr. Wee Yong (Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of AnthoBio) at the University of Calgary that investigates a generic drug, hydroxychloroquine, in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) recently published its clinical study results in Annals of Neurology. The study followed 35 PPMS patients over a period of five years. Throughout the study, 14 patients were expected to develop a significant reduction in their walking function. However, only 8 patients had experienced a reduction by the end of the study. Thats almost a 50% reduction in the number of PPMS patients negatively affected by continuing disability. Although the results will require confirmation in a larger trial, this study has shown that hydroxychloroquine could help slow down the disability progression of PPMS. This study opens the possibility for future treatment option for PPMS and the researchers hope their work will inspire future larger scale clinical research on the drug for PPMS.

Follow up after almost 2 weeks post GB removal. Still have a couple lingering symptoms.

The left side of my back under my ribs starts to hurt, then I get a little shaky, my hands sweat and I yawn and fart a lot lol.

It seems to be episodic, it lasts for anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour or so. It happens specifically in the AM, 12pm and 5pm and after a BM. Usually just one of those times a day.

From everything I have researched, this is a rare mutation and specific to a region that I am from (could be wrong, but there is just not a lot of info I found on this mutation). 

My mind is just blown and I had no idea I was a carrier. No one in my family from either parents had CF. At least none that Ive ever heard of. I didnt even know about CF until about 10 years ago.

My husband is going to get tested to see if he is a carrier and then go from there. I am trying to stay positive, but its been hard.

*Summary: A study of monozygotic twins allowed researchers to discover which parts of immune dysfunction in multiple sclerosis were influenced by genetics, and which were influenced by environmental factors.*

Researchers at the University of Zurich and Munichs LMU Klinikum hospital have studied the immune system of pairs of monozygotic twins to identify the influence of the environment and of genetics in cases of multiple sclerosis. In the process, they may have discovered precursor cells of the disease-causing T cells.

**Genetic predisposition alone does not lead to MS**

Studies in recent years have clearly shown that genetic risk variants are a necessary condition for developing multiple sclerosis. Based on our study, we were able to show that about half of the composition of our immune system is determined by genetics, says Florian Ingelfinger, a Ph.D. candidate at the UZH Institute of Experimental Immunology.

In the study, the researchers recruited 61 pairs of monozygotic twins where one twin is affected by MS and the co-twin is healthy. From a genetic point of view, the twins were thus identical. Although the healthy twins also had the maximum genetic risk for MS, they showed no clinical signs of the disease, says Lisa Ann Gerdes.

**Thanks to this globally unique cohort of identical twins, the researchers were able to exclude genetic influences by comparing twins with and without multiple sclerosis.**

*We are exploring the central question of how the immune system of two genetically identical individuals leads to significant inflammation and massive nerve damage in one case, and no damage at all in the other,* explains Burkhard Becher. **Using identical twins enabled the international team of scientists to rule out the genetic influence and specifically track the immune system changes that were ultimately responsible for triggering MS in one twin.**

*Surprisingly, we found the biggest differences in the immune profiles of MS affected twins in to be in the cytokine receptors, i.e., the way immune cells communicate with one another. The cytokine network is like the language of the immune system,* says Ingelfinger.

**The researchers found that increased sensitivity to certain cytokines leads to greater activation of T cells in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis. These T cells are more likely to migrate into the central nervous system of patients and cause damage there. The identified cells were found to have the characteristics of recently activated cells, which were in the process of developing into fully functional T cells. *We may have discovered the cellular big bang of MS hereprecursor cells that give rise to disease-causing T cells,* says Becher.**

*The findings of this study are particularly valuable in comparison to previous studies of MS which do not control for genetic predisposition, says Burkhard Becher. We are thus able to find out which part of the immune dysfunction in MS is influenced by genetic components and which by environmental factors. This is of fundamental importance in understanding the development of the disease.*

Hi gang. Im wondering if anyone has experienced a relapse that does not show new lesion activity on MRI? I had my scans at the beginning of Feb and all is stable (yay!). But I started having some weakness in my arm around the same time and it was a bit insidious in that it was kind of slow to come on and then got worse quite quickly. I had been having sensory issues in that arm for so long (neuro aware) but I had a disc issue in my c spine last year so I chalked it up to that. My MRI shows that disc issue is fully resolved and back its vertebrae house (also yay!). But my left arm and hand are very weak and it has spread across my shoulders. I also have spasticity in my left armpit, my ribcage is in pain and feels tight. My specialist is not convinced that what is happening right now is mechanical, which was my assumption and why I waited to report the symptoms until my arm was so weak that I couldnt really function very well. Which in hindsight, I should have called earlier. I just assumed it was my neck and upper back acting up and that it would get better. I really struggle sometimes determining what is just my back being my back and what is related to MS. 

I feel pretty confused by all of this because I dont have any lesions in my spinal cord showing on an MRI and nothing new in my brain, though for some reason they didnt use contrast this time for any of my scans and perhaps something small was missed in my spine? My specialist is concerned that based on my symptom presentation and the exam that my spinal cord is inflamed and that I am having a relapse. He said that MRIs cannot see everything and it doesnt pick up small lesions or all of the inflammation that is happening in the CNS. He has prescribed me a course of the devils tictacs (steroids ) to take to try and speed things up and reduce symptoms. 

Has this happened to any of you before where your MRI looked stable with no progression but you were having a relapse? I googled and I found a lot about this happening in SPMS or PPMS but I am still fairly early in my disease as per my neuro.

Hope you guys all have a nice weekend.

Reference: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31327047/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31327047/)

**Purpose:** The aim of this study was to assess the superiority of low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) diet plus Bacillus coagulans supplementation to low FODMAP diet alone in the reduction of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.

**Methods:** In this randomized clinical trial, fifty IBS patients who met Rome IV criteria for IBS were randomly assigned to receive a low FODMAP diet plus either a probiotic or a placebo capsule for 8 weeks. Probiotic capsules contained 109B. coagulans spores and 400 mg inulin, while placebo capsules consisted of 500 mg rice starch.

**Results:** Significant improvements were observed in abdominal pain intensity and frequency, abdominal distension, satisfaction with bowel habits, quality of life, defecation consistency, and patient-reported severity score in both groups; however, only improvement in severity score was significantly higher in probiotic group compared with placebo group (P = 0.001). Moreover, the frequency of patients with clinical improvement in IBS-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) was significantly more in probiotic group compared to placebo group (P = 0.038).

**Conclusion:** Our results indicate that the addition of probiotic supplement containing B. coagulans to the low FODMAP diet might be superior to low FODMAP diet in alleviating IBS symptoms."

I've been on a DMA ever since, and got no new lesions in 5 years.

Hi,

Has anyone looked into this [syndrome](https://www.healthline.com/health/upper-crossed-syndrome#outlook)? 

I was diagnosed with costochondritis a few months ago, and I am 99% sure that it has to do with my poor posture, muscular imbalance and obesity. 

While I am working on all three at the moment in my own limited ways, I came across the article mentioned above while googling my symptoms. I suspect I might have this since I spent the entire covid lockdown in front of my laptop either gaming or working (usually in a sub-optimal position)

I have also noticed that I get flare ups when I am either gaming or spending more time at my desk or when I am standing and looking at my phone (I hunch forward to do this sometimes). On the days when I don't, I feel fine. I have also noticed that my pec muscles are particularly tight and seem to be in line with the symptoms mentioned in the aforementioned link as well as [here](https://www.airrosti.com/injuries-we-treat/upper-cross-syndrome/#:~:text=The%20imbalanced%20muscles%20associated%20with,Chest%20pain%20and%20tightness)

Hello!

So my doctor seems to think I (24F) have POTs but Im not getting a tilt table test done. I didnt push for it but should I?

A little backstory: I began experiencing symptoms last year and have even seen a cardiologist because in the beginning, I was convinced it was my heart that was the problem. Thankfully thats not the case. Ive had my heart checked (holter monitor, EKGs and most recently an echocardiogram). My primary doctor said that if the echocardiogram results came back normal, which they did, then she is pretty confident that I may have POTs. However, my cardiologist never mentioned POTs and didnt sound too worried about my symptoms, and my primary doctor doesnt think I need to be tested any further.

Ive always wondered if I had a bad circulation problem but never had any extreme symptoms until the middle of 2021. The very first sign that something as off was when I noticed my fingernails turned blue after a workout, but they quickly returned to normal. This would happen again randomly but not very often. 

Next, I began noticing purple/red-ish hands and feet/legs after standing in the shower. Around this time I also started having dull chest pains and shortness of breath accompanied by a high heart rate anytime Id stand and walk. Part of this I thought was due to some anxiety, because I began worrying something was wrong with my heart. It still gets very high. At rest, lying horizontally, my resting heart rate will be in the 80s on a good day, but rise to 120-130 easily upon standing and walking. Im afraid to start working out again even though my doctor has said its okay to because I feel like it could easily get to 200 or more.

My doctor has also advised me how to manage my symptoms and gave me propranolol to take when needed, but Im still concerned about my heart despite the tests coming back ok. Just today, I challenged myself to a a walk down the street to lunch and back, and after walking up a few stairs, my heart rate on my Apple Watch reached 194. I know everything is physically ok with my heart but this still worries me.  

So now what do I do? Im guessing its time to just manage my symptoms and get on with life but Im still scared my heart will just give out eventually or something. Ive looked at my previous heart data months prior to developing more of the symptoms and was is still really high, I guess I just never thought about it. Maybe its also due to me not being as in shape as I used to. I just cant stop thinking about it."

Just diagnosed and not on DMT yet
Hey everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. I was hoping I wouldnt have to join this group but my diagnosis was confirmed last week and here I am. I will say Im already grateful for this group and the wealth of knowledge and positivity here. 

So heres my dilemma: Im currently in limbo waiting to see a neurologist and get on a DMT, and feeling unsure what I should be doing for my covid booster. The wait time to see the neuro could be 1 - 8 weeks 
 
My concerns specifically:

- I still have symptoms from the relapse that led to my diagnosis. I dont know if this is considered an active relapse or my body is healing? Some symptoms have completely resolved, some improved, and some are the same.   The newest symptom onset was Dec. 26.

- I do want to get the booster ASAP due to omicron threat, and the fact that once Im on a DMT I wont get as good of an immune response 

- Im scared that the booster could cause another relapse but then again, I know covid would be worse 

- I had Pfizer for both first and second shots, minimal side effects (relapse did not happen until 4 months after second dose). I have the option to get Pfizer or Moderna. Im leaning toward Pfizer but would like to hear others thoughts and experiences  


Lastly, I understand the best thing for me to do is speak to a health care professional. I have, and the general guidance is to get the vaccine and either one is fine. However none of the professionals Ive talked to specialize in MS and so Im just looking for additional information/guidance/peace of mind from this community.

So today I got some routine blood work done. The lab reports came back showing I had very high WBC, high neutrophils absolute, and low lymphocytes. (Google says that it usually indicates the body is fighting an infection or the big C.)

I had just gotten my wisdom tooth removed yesterday and prior to that I was on antibiotics for about 2 weeks. I was having severe pain and discomfort prior to the tooth being removed(massive cavity/decay on that wisdom boy).

My concern comes from seeing those abnormal results, primarily in those fields(everything else was normal and in the green). Has anyone encountered abnormal blood results after being on Ocrevus? Or even after being on antibiotics while on Ocrevus?

I know theres always an increased risk of cancer when dealing certain medications, and that a high WBC is an indicator of such. I have reached out to my doctor with these concerns, but have yet to hear back, so I wanted to chime in here to see what yalls thoughts and experiences have been. And if there have been similar situations with anyone.

This method basically cured my costochondritis. The only time it flairs back up is when I eat super spicy food, drink super caffeinated drinks or extremely over exert myself. I think everyone should try it. Its simple and cheap. If it doesnt work you'll lose like $1.50 so why not try?

Hello,

Although these are not my symptoms. I was wondering why and how do people experience shortness of breath and crushing chest pain with costochondritis? I do not doubt the symptoms and what you all feel. 

I guess what I am trying to ask with the definitions that Drs and experts have given. Crushing chest pain seems really severe and outside the realms of the inflammation of the rib cartilage at the sternum. And the shortness of breath would be something pulmonary if it is literally stopping you from breathing.

However I do understand that the pain can make it hard to take a full deep breath ( what I feel) when you exhale or inhale. Or our good old friend anxiety can cause the feeling like you have shortness of breath.

None of these are reproducible  or are they ? ( the crushing chest pain and feeling like you cant breathe). People and doctors really emphasize that when gettting diagnosed, that pains are reproducible. But are they?"

Hi there!

I've just recently (perhaps 3 months ago) started to feel pain near the sternum when I tried to lift out of bed, and it freaked me out. It cooled down after a few weeks, but I wanted to see my GP just to make sure. He then pressed some of my ribs and cartilages and diagnosed me with a costochondritis. I didn't feel a sharp pain at the moment because the spot was a little better at the time, but I could still feel the point where I used to feel it before. 

After that, a few weeks from now, I started to feel a little anxious because of other routine exams I had to do and I got a little worried with a new onset daily mild asthma crisis that also contributed to it all. Anyhow, I started to feel a dull pain stretching from my right chest and coming all the way down to the rib until a spot, let's say, a palm below my armpit. Sometimes when I press around the spot I feel it is a little painful, and around the ribs near that I feel it is tender to touch. Sometimes, I feel uncomfortable from this point to my back also. 

I talked to my GP on the phone and he said that it could be also the way of costochondritis, following the intercostal nerves, along with muscle strain. What the GP thinks may have caused my costo is possibly the fact that I use to hold my 2yo kid in a baby body carrier, for at least an hour everyday in different parts of the day, and the weight increases pressure on that side of my chest. 

I only feel pain when I make certain moves with my arm and body, specially lifting stuff in a posture that's not very ideal. It's like the whole rib or chest area would show up in that pain that resembles a muscle strain.

I did recently a lung ct scan that came up normal. I wanted to share this description of my history in this sub because I read a lot of other reassuring stories that deal with similar issues, and I thought maybe someone could have similar symptons or stories, so that I can have more certainty that what I have is costo.

I also think that not only my recent daily asthma crisis (which I'm already treating), but also my costo, is related to anxiety in some level. It's great not to be alone."

Hey all, I hope everyone is coping as well as can be expected at the moment.

If it's OK, I'd like to share some of my experiences as a Physio treating Costo/Tietze in the hope it helps anyone struggling. As someone who is really passionate about trying to better understand the inner workings of musculoskeletal issues, I think I've developed a really broad perspective on what these issues actually are and how to go about getting them to go away.

First and foremost, I understand how challenging and draining these conditions can be particularly when it doesn't feel like you're making progress. They can really debilitate and frustrate even the hardiest person over time! Secondly, I think a large proportion of the medical industry doesn't quite yet fully understand the bigger picture associated with Costo/Tietze and its cause, which often leads to treatment that ultimately misses the mark - despite our best intentions.

And from what I find with my patients, one of the biggest things that get missed a lot is the association between Costo/Tietze and relatively hidden dysfunction around the back. I've posted about this before, but the idea is that a lot of pain at the front/side is a consequence of covert joint stiffness/tightness/overloaded tissue where those ribs insert at the back. I've found looking for and resolving these issues to be a crucial piece of the puzzle for anyone wanting to resolve their symptoms.

Furthermore, I find a really strong link between stress/trauma and persistent Costo/Tietze pain. Whether it be pretty intense past trauma/abuse, or current ongoing work, financial, relationship, religious, cultural stress, etc., these types of things can cause our nervous systems to become chronically heightened over time leaving the door ajar for the pain to develop and hang around. 

In essence, Costo/Tietze (like most aches, pains, and injuries) is more than just a really painful area in isolation. As a fully functioning human being, it's important to take a step back and consider what's going on as a whole in order to get a really strong sense of what's needed to get better.

If it helps, I've put together a far more in-depth video this time for my patients that covers 7 things I think are generally missing from most people's rehab when I see them clinically. 

I genuinely hope this information is useful and again am happy to answer any questions that might pop up! All the best with it going forward.

I just joined this group, so I apologize if this is not allowed.
I have been researching what I feel to be abnormal symptoms Ive been dealing with the majority of my life (dizziness, nausea when standing, etc).. Anyways, Ive been researching few weeks now and I recently came across POTS Syndrome. I found that it affects your heart rate so I decided to test mine while resting and then standing to see if maybe thats what it could be.
I took my heart rate three times while laying in bed. at 1:37am, by heart rate was 73bpm. at 1:39am, my heart rate was 74bpm. at 1:40am, my heart rate was 73 bpm again.
I then stood up (right next to my bed) and proceeded to take my heart rate again. Immediately it shot up to more than double my resting heart rate at 1:41am my heart rate was 156bpm i took it again a minute later and at 1:42am my heart rate was 153bpm.
Even if its not pots, just from standing up, I feel like this is not a normal bodily response for the majority of the population. Dont know how to go about getting this checked out.
By the way, not sure if it matters, but I am a 19 year old girl."

If you think about it, everyone lives in a sort-of psychosis, because most things in society are imaginative constructs. A professor in a twead coat, with a cane and a monocle, playing with the role and the demeanor of being the most-learned person while his students as servile subjects gaze up at him, supposing him an academic lord he is psychotic.

A prime minister playing king, a therapist posturing as a mans great counselor. These altered states of mind and social roles are nothing more than imaginations, not so severe as a mentally-ill person on a sleepless, 3-day bender with mania but nevertheless.

Also, if you feel youre being watched, you may be: post-9/11, there are cameras everywhere. The federal government has been found to have been listening to phone conversations and monitoring Internet search history. Rich socialite Epstein had hundreds of cameras on their facility scarcely-visible to the naked eye, even in bathrooms.

The technologic society we now live in,  the technologic state is likened unto a psychotic jungle of concrete and steel. Something like 20% of Americans are on antidepressants.

The world is mentally ill, and millions struggle through altered mental states; strong beliefs that are imposed upon others and accepted merely by social proof.

Demons descend and ascend, and patients believe themselves ill, because higher-up Magicians who are CEOs and Presidents who are in league with these spiritual powers are to convince these lower men that they are indeed crazy. Here it says, in the DSM book. Now we return to the shadows in hoods and masks to sacrifice a man. And we will be spying on you via the state apparatus which we control.

There are indeed people who are legitimately psychotic.

However, there are many others, who being told they are psychotic, are instead simply chaffed against a world far crazier, backwards, and perverse than they."

I think I have only officially posted like 3 times for being the OP but do make a lot of comments but wanted to get my wording right and not give false information.

~I will be editing this post as suggestions come~

Would you say that this would be the correct way to meet the criteria for POTS:

ONLY YOU know whats NORMAL for you and YOUR body so if you have ANY abnormal symptoms you should always speak to your doctor about your concerns.

For possible P.O.T.S you can do a Poor mans TTT at home and then discuss with your doctor. I would recommend saving your results on paper or on video so they can see proof and have a better understanding of whats happening but a lot of other conditions can cause POTS symptoms so they may need to run a lot of test and be patient because POTS is a process of elimination.

When doing the Poor Mans Tilt Test its best to do it for the full 10 mins and to check blood pressure as well if possible.Here is a chart that I used if you are interested:

https://batemanhornecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NASA-Lean-Test-Instructions-1.pdf

https://imgur.com/a/H36mjvF

If you meet the PoTs criteria:

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a blood circulation disorder characterized by two factors:

A specific group of symptoms that frequently occur when standing upright(but also with other postural changes): 
Lightheadedness,dizziness,chest pressure,Brain fog,Palpitations,Blood pooling,Feeling faint or actually fainting;just to name a few.
(You do not need to have all of the above)

A heart rate increase from horizontal(try to rest for at least 2-5 minutes to get resting heart rate)to standing (or as tested on a tilt table) of at least 30 beats per minute in adults, or at least 40 beats per minute in adolescents, measured during the first 10 minutes of standing and is sustained above the 30bpm increase after the initial rise.

*That means that even if it didnt rise immediately but within the 10 minute timeframe it counts but should be over the 30bpm after it ramps up and doesnt drop below the threshold.*

A persons resting heart rate ranges from 60-100 and upon standing the heart rate increases *up to 30+*beats per minute when standing up, and then it settles down again by 2 minutes. For people with postural tachycardia syndrome, the heart rate goes up considerably higher when they stand, often increasing 30 to 50 beats per minute or more and is sustained over the 30bpm within the 10 minute time frame.This can lead to lightheadedness, dizziness and fainting.

*The most important thing to note is that the HR is sustained above the +30/40 resting rate while standing and doesnt drop below*

~If your heart rate is still around +20/+25 and is still sustained over after two minutes you may still have Pots or some other form of dysautonomia or other condition and as always best to speak to your doctor about it.~

POTS is diagnosed only when orthostatic hypotension is ruled out and when there is no acute dehydration or blood loss. Orthostatic hypotension is a form of low blood pressure: 20mm Hg drop in systolic or a 10mm Hg drop in diastolic blood pressure in the first three minutes of standing upright.

Congestion, postnasal drip that roosts in my lungs and causes infections and asthma, constant headaches, and poor sleep.  Im mentally spent and Im always tired.

I have finally found something that helps!

I struggled with not digesting my food properly for years, sometimes throwing up a meal Id eaten the day before, completely undigested. But around 02 is when the hospital visits started. I will suddenly be overcome with horrific pain & vomiting, becoming dehydrated and going into shock. Sometimes Im treated & released but often I am admitted to get this all under control. Its been rare for me to go more than a month without needing the hospital.  I have been unable to work (or do much of anything else) since 2012. My gastroparesis is probably the result of invasive abdominal surgeries. It was not the result of being diabetic.

What has happened to my system over the years is my bowels hardly move. I have gone over a week without a BM and have relied on laxatives almost daily. And my bowel movements are indescribably painful. I often need an hour or 2 to go & recover. There is pain and nausea nearly every day and the constant threat of ER visits looming over my head. I have seen some of the best gastroenterologists in the country and no one has been able to help. Ive tried reglan, domperidone, Zofran and dozens of other drugs and treatment methods. Everything that did help a little caused side effects and Id have to stop them. In the last couple of years, my life has been reduced to nothing but getting through the pain of each day and the dread of the next ER visit. In fact, it had gotten to the point that I was looking into my options for assisted suicide. Ive had enough and was ready to give up.

Then in May, my doctor prescribed Pyridostigmine. It was on a list of meds to try but I wasnt given much hope for it. I looked into it & found no real research on it for gastroparesis other than a few references that it may have helped some patients. I didnt have any hope in it whatsoever but had nothing to lose and honestly didnt care anymore. But then something amazing happened.

***I have not been to the hospital in 6 months!!!*** That is so unbelievable to me and my doctors! Its been more than 10 years since Ive been able to say that!

It hasnt cured me. I still deal with pain and nausea almost daily. I still have to be really careful about going out and I still have to treat these symptoms with meds sometimes. My bowel movements are still incredibly painful, sometimes taking me hours to get through the cramping and spasms. But I am having one nearly every day and I AM NOT GOING TO THE ER!!!! So that is incredible.

My doctors are thrilled. Weve talked a little about trying to see if there is something that will help with my daily pain. But right now, we are all just happy I have been out of the ER.

I my not be 100% better but I couldnt be more grateful for this improvement. And obviously, nothing we know of works for everyone. But this has helped me. So I wanted to put it out there for others to know about and try it if you are in a similar situation."

The side effects are much better now but on days without proper sleep they are guaranteed bad ones. I don't lose concience during any of my seizures but it's still annoying not to be able to finish my workouts because my brain goes bonkers.

In December I had a lung CT scan, and they found a nodule on my thyroid measuring 1 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm


Did a biology, and the results came back as Bethesda V.

Today I received my ThyroSeq results and its the following: 

- Positive. Probability of cancer high (>99%).  

- The specimen revealed two mutations, BARF V600E and PIK3CA, which confer a very high (&gt;99%) probability of cancer, specifically of papillary carcinoma or related advanced cancers. 

- Co-occurrence of BARF and PIK3CA is associated with a high risk of recurrence, and a higher likelihood of tumor dedifferentiation. 

- Because of the association with high-risk cancer, total thyroidectomy is likely to be an optimal surgical approach. 



So does this mean I have to remove my entire thyroid for 1cm nodule on my left side? And because of the PIK3CA gene, could I also have other types of cancers?

Morning all,

Has anybody experienced this? Its happened to me a few times over the last few months now, but isnt something Ive ever experienced beforehand in my 8 years of being T1D.

Blood sugar was 7.8 mmol/L when I injected 14 units Levemir at 9:40 this morning. Ive had no Novorapid, and had just finished eating some eggs and avocado so no bolus required. At 10:00, my CGM started showing double down arrows and my finger prick showed 4.7 mmol/L when it had been slowly rising when I took my Levemir. My CGM showed a drop of 1 mmol/L every 3 minutes, and eventually went as low as 3.2 mmol/L before my emergency bottle of Coke kicked in and I started slowly rising.

Ive heard of this happening with Lantus but not with Levemir, yet I believe this is the third time its happened to me in as many months. I pinched enough skin to avoid muscle (injected in my thigh), and there was no blood upon removing the needle. It was a very standard injection as far as I can tell.

Im awaiting a call back from my hospital team to see if they can recommend anything, but the last time this happened they essentially told me they dont know what happened. Im pretty terrified of injecting tomorrow morning now.

Any similar experiences with Levemir?"

I've been dealing with reflux and gastritis since June of 2020 so I started taking omeprazole (which screwed up my stomach BIG TIME and I'm convinced is actually what ruined my body instead of my minor nighttime reflux I started taking it for).

After months of dealing with that I tried dropping it for something else, but I started getting major heart palpitations and would wake up with my heart racing like 120-130bpm. It would keep happening throughout the day but all my doctors said it was anxiety (since I've had issues with that most of my life) but I know my body well enough to know the difference.

I hopped onto 40mg pantoprazole and some daily anxiety meds from a psychiatrist which seemed to make the heart stuff go away at first and my stomach improved just from getting off the omeprazole, but I still havent been able to really eat and the 'correct foods' are still bothering me. 

Long story short, I've messed with my panto doses like 3 times and each time after a few days of either pausing it or cutting it in half I've had all the heart stuff come back, even with me still taking my anxiety meds. I did have a lot of testing done last year from my cardio (granted everything I did came after I got the meds so my heart had calmed down) which all came back normal, but when I ask my doctors about these side effects from stopping PPIs they all just kinda look at me, shrug, and say I'm a weird case and it's anxiety.

I've got a new GI doc who seems nicer and wants to get me off them onto some famotidine, but in the process of weaning off getting there to try that I'm back to the same square of a constant racing heart and palpitations. It's been almost two weeks now and the only thing kinda keeping them in check is me taking my emergency panic attack meds.

I've read stories about people having this kind of stuff happen WHILE they're taking it, but has anyone had any bad side effects getting off them like this? I kinda just need to know I'm not alone since my other doctors all point at each other in a circle and say 'ask that one'."

I wake up a lot easier as before I would wake up groggy and just completely unfunctional .. which would then lead to me being easily distracted etc, and my focus throughout the day seems improved ... mood seems improved ... but, at around 4pm I crash hard and just feel exhausted at night. I had some family over at the weekend and was unable to keep up in conversation. Also after a few days it seems to have less of an effect ... but then I up the dose and it works again. Obviously this won't be sustainable and I will eventually reach max dose.  


I would like to try Elvanse next as I've heard people say the come down is less brutal ... but it takes longer to kick in, which is a problem for me as I find it most difficult in the morning.

As you can see I'm kinda very self conscious about my image and that's my main concern instead of, y'know, the possibility of dying lol Guess that makes me a spoiled brat of sorts.

I keep thinking if there was anyway I could've prevented this. Like, if there was something I could've done differently so I would be fine. Not that it matters anyway because I couldn't do anything now regardless.

I also have been thinking about things I wanted to do RIGHT NOW. Can't really come up with anything tbh. I guess I lived a pretty good life. Might write a letter for my parents to read in case I die though.

So, I guess the overall question is how does the scar look after a few years? Like shit or like some cool battlescar that may or may not make you look kinda badass? Also, does your voice eventually come back?

I wanted to share my story in hopes it could possibly help someone or there are other people going through what I'm experiencing.   
Like many others here my story began several years ago with constant nagging, gnawing heartburn for which I was prescribed Omeprazole. This seemed to remedy my symptoms, and even though I've always had a fear/aversion to being on a long-term medication before I knew it, it had been 3 years or so. Until one day the original symptoms came back, and this time way worse. I began experiencing that feeling of a fist trying to punch its way up and out of my chest. I even questioned if I had heart issues. It was pretty awful, so after several rounds of tests, including an Endoscopy, I was told I had a hiatal hernia. The GI Dr. switched me from 20 mg of Omeprazole to 40 mg and Pantoprazole and that calmed down the pain. Again, even though I was still wary of an even higher dose of daily medication, being relieved of the pain outweighed these fears and before I knew it, another 3 or so years had gone by being a slave to this drug.   
Then about a year ago I began having horrible pain in my pelvic region. I won't go into all the details, but nothing about it made me think it was a GI issue, more of a urologic issue. So after rounds of antibiotics for what they thought was prostatitis, CT scans, and even cystoscopy (if you don't know that that is look it up. Basically medieval torture!) - all of it inconclusive. I was so desperate I even tried acupuncture which did nothing. I was beginning to believe I had CPPS (chronic pelvic pain syndrome), when as a last-ditch desperate move I decided to try eliminating gluten from my diet. To my astonishment, within a little over a week, all of my symptoms magically vanished!  
I'm about 8 months into my gluten-free diet and feel great, but I began questioning what could have caused this. Why at the age of 41 did my body suddenly decide to reject gluten? I did a celiac test and it was negative and have no family history of gluten intolerance. After doing some research I came across a study that found a link between [PPI use and gluten intolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947159/) and my jaw hit the floor.  
I now believe this long-term use of PPIs has caused this and am currently in the process of trying to wean off the Pantoprazole by cutting it in half and taking it only every other day. The GERD symptoms have returned however so I've scheduled another appt with the GI Dr to discuss a way forward without PPIs. I'm holding out a small bit of hope that if I'm able to completely go off the PPPs the gluten intolerance could possibly reverse, but I know that's not likely.   
Does anyone have any alternative approaches besides the obvious diet restrictions to keep GURD at bay without this evil medication?"

I wanted to share my story in hopes it could possibly help someone or there are other people going through what I'm experiencing.   
Like many others here my story began several years ago with constant nagging, gnawing heartburn for which I was prescribed Omeprazole. This seemed to remedy my symptoms, and even though I've always had a fear/aversion to being on a long-term medication before I knew it, it had been 3 years or so. Until one day the original symptoms came back, and this time way worse. I began experiencing that feeling of a fist trying to punch its way up and out of my chest. I even questioned if I had heart issues. It was pretty awful, so after several rounds of tests, including an Endoscopy, I was told I had a hiatal hernia. The GI Dr. switched me from 20 mg of Omeprazole to 40 mg and Pantoprazole and that calmed down the pain. Again, even though I was still wary of an even higher dose of daily medication, being relieved of the pain outweighed these fears and before I knew it, another 3 or so years had gone by being a slave to this drug.   
Then about a year ago I began having horrible pain in my pelvic region. I won't go into all the details, but nothing about it made me think it was a GI issue, more of a urologic issue. So after rounds of antibiotics for what they thought was prostatitis, CT scans, and even cystoscopy (if you don't know that that is look it up. Basically medieval torture!) - all of it inconclusive. I was so desperate I even tried acupuncture which did nothing. I was beginning to believe I had CPPS (chronic pelvic pain syndrome), when as a last-ditch desperate move I decided to try eliminating gluten from my diet. To my astonishment, within a little over a week, all of my symptoms magically vanished!  
I'm about 8 months into my gluten-free diet and feel great, but I began questioning what could have caused this. Why at the age of 41 did my body suddenly decide to reject gluten? I did a celiac test and it was negative and have no family history of gluten intolerance. After doing some research I came across a study that found a link between [PPI use and gluten intolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947159/) and my jaw hit the floor.  
I now believe this long-term use of PPIs has caused this and am currently in the process of trying to wean off the Pantoprazole by cutting it in half and taking it only every other day. The GERD symptoms have returned however so I've scheduled another appt with the GI Dr to discuss a way forward without PPIs. I'm holding out a small bit of hope that if I'm able to completely go off the PPPs the gluten intolerance could possibly reverse, but I know that's not likely.   
Does anyone have any alternative approaches besides the obvious diet restrictions to keep GURD at bay without this evil medication?"

Following tests showed rapid emptying of both the stomach and small bowel.

Hi there! 

Sorry for the long story:

After 4 years of struggle, I was finally diagnosed with hiatus hernia (grade A) and esofagitis. I also have a horrible cough that has been going on for the past 3 years and has been happening increasingly more often, to the point where now it's almost every day. I'm scared of being stuck with any permanent damage to my throat or lungs..

Basically it all started 4 years ago with my heart fluttering/beating hard after every meal. I was prescribed xanax without even having checked my heart.. even though i never had any anxiety problems. For 6 months I took xanax and had the same symptoms, so all the doctors told me to 'just chill, you're stressing too much'. Then a cough started, always at night, lasting between 1-3 hours, i thought it was the smoking so i reduced the cigarettes but it still happened. The doctor did an xray said my lungs are fine and just to stop smoking, but even stopping smoking didn't fix it. It used to happen every few months, then every month, and now every week, almost every single day for the past 10 days. 

The pills don't work, the diet doesn't work, I'm just losing hope in everything, and everything my doctor can say is well, you just have to take omeprazol twice a day for the rest of your life. I'm 31, I don't want to take any pills every day for the rest of my life, especially not one that can damage my kidneys or cause osteoporosis. 

I'm down to a very light decaf coffee a day with a lot of no dairy milk, I'm staying away from sweets such as chocolate, fried and greasy foods. I took omeprazol for the past 3 months, with little to no relief. I quit it for 2 weeks and immediately felt better, only for it to start again right after the endoscopy, so now i'm back on it. 

If you have any tips, any tips at all for living with this or making it more bearable, please do share, because I feel like i'm going up the walls, like I'm only a shell of myself. How do you deal with this?

I did RAI in July and am about to go in for a CT scan that uses contrast fluid thats high in iodine.

My guess is that it would have no effect as my understanding is that most radioiodine leaves the body pretty soon after taking the pill and the months long cancer-killing effect is a drawn out result of the radiation exposure that happens in those first few days of RAI. In this sense, iodine taken well after RAI would not replace radioactive iodine absorbed by thyroid cells.

Hi,

I have been dealing with GERD for a little over a year now. I'm on pantoprazole 40mg 2x/day and while that has helped with symptoms, and I am doing much better than I was when symptoms first began, I still experience symptoms such as regurgitation, burping, bloating, etc.

I had a gastric emptying scan that showed mild delay in gastric emptying during the liquid portion.  My doctor has prescribed metoclopramide as she said she believes this will help my symptoms.

I am a little worried about this medication because of the long list of potential side effects. Does anyone have any experience with this? My question is, from my understanding, you can only take this med up to 12 weeks. Does it only help provide relief for the time you're on the medication, or does it have a long-lasting effect that is beneficial? Because it does not seem worth it if the help is only for when you are on the medication.

Any experience is helpful. Thanks!"

Should I start again? (Going to see GP on friday) + Need advice
I haven't been diagnosed with anything but symptoms is related to gerd/acid reflux and I'm kind of new to all of this gerd stuff. 





Last month, I had the most terrible heartburn (before taking medication) and went to see my GP next day. I told my doctor the problem and the doctor did some quick checkups like blood pressure, oximeter pulse, felt my stomach and liver, listen to my heart beat and said its all good. He then prescribed me lansoprazole 30mg and said to take them for 4 week

I took it on the first day. Nothing special happened and felt the same until on my 5th day, my symptoms gotten better to nothing. Then here is where the mistakes starts to begin. After a few days of dieting from 1-7 days, I started to eat fried food, takeaways, fish and chips, spicy foods, fizzy drinks. Nothing had happened so I thought I was all good. These capsules made hungry a lot so I always have something to eat. Began eating chocolate, crisps, sweets etc. 

I then researched online that I was meant to take it for 2 weeks since its not safe to take long term. Now this is the regret I'm feeling right now. My doctor said to take it for 4 weeks but instead, I only did for 2 weeks just because of anxiety from online. Basically thinking of the worst and negatives on ppi's.

After I stopped on week 2, I just went cold turkey after. Nothing really happened on my first week as I still ate spicy food, takeaways, you name it. Then I started to notice some burning sensation on my chest (mild but it is bothersome) and Then after I completely lost my appetite. 

Now I'm on 2nd week of stopping lansoprazole and I'm still feeling the same like No appetite and burning sensation on the chest. To be honest I don't know if this is acid rebound as somebody said that it feels like ""kicking you in the stomach every 30 seconds"") which I don't feel like that. It's more of a flare up feeling at the moment as it sounds like.

Looking back now, I feel ashamed. I should of done better and researched more. I'm now feeling sad and upset and I don't know if I'm ever gonna be healed. Feeling deepest regrets just writing this post. I should of listened to my doctor and this time I went to take this more seriously.



Coud anybody give me advice in advance. It would be greatly  appreciated. 

Will these symptoms go away?

Should I give it another go? (Think will do it anyways)

Thank you for taking your time reading. 

I will keep updating this post from now on.




Quick Update 24/12/2021: so I went to see my GP and told my mistake. He told me to do a full course this time for 4 week with lansoprazole. He then gave me a stool test for pylori. But since I haven't taken PPI'S for 2 weeks I can do it straight away before I go back to ppi's 

I noticed some symptom I had from 2 days ago. I mentioned that I had no appetite, well it came back yesterday and today aswell. I was so hungry when I was trying to sleep. At the moment, the symptoms I only have is irritation feeling in the chest. It does feeling something wrong tho. It's not painful but bothersome.

I'm hoping to get sorted out soon. I will keep posted from now on. I will let you guys know about the shit test aswell.

Update 1/15/22:

Hello all, so it's been 3 weeks since I'm on ppi's again and I'm feeling OK for starters. The only issue now is throat pain after a little cough. Usually goes away in like 3 seconds but I dont know what it could be but apart from that I'm feeling OK. Doesn't feel burning but more feeling like an ache. I've been eating better than before and drank pretty much just water nearly for a month now. I did a stool test 3 weeks ago and nothing got back to me so hopefully I assume that nothing was there. At the moment I'm tapering and stopping on the 4th week, the hopefully, I can live without them.

So, with lansoprazole, it's been all over the place. When I started I had constant diarrhea for like 4 days. Then after that I had bad constipation. I took a medicine that my dad uses when he has constipation. After that I took like 10ml of it, I had the biggest shit of my life. Big relief after that I think my stomach adjusted itself and now shitting normally I guess?. Anyways, however it messed up my mentality. I feel more tired and waking up the middle of the night. Its Tiring but I'm still fighting. I think that's it really, just affecting my mentality and energy. I think I'm low on b12, magnesium I think but idk. I'm tapering right now so hope for the best I can do this, if not then well, I have to go to the doctors again and request a endoscopy."

I'm a 28m who has been recently diagnosed with AS. I'm on two 500mg tablets of naproxen per day, and take a PPI in the morning to keep them from upsetting my stomach.

TL;DR: Epilepsy since 7/21. On trileptal. Also have ADHD. My emotional outbursts/episodes/panic attacks have increased and become severe. Also all ADHD symptoms are multiplied by 100. Exec function, memory, attentiveness... nonexistent. To the point of affecting life. Does my neuro or psych help first?? (I have upcoming appointments with both)


I have pretty severe ADHD (34, F). I have been diagnosed my entire life. I have been able to manage myself VERY well my entire adult life without medication. Even with my career. I do have sensory and mood issues too, but I have been great at managing them and realizing what's triggers them. 

I had my first and only nocturnal TC seizure 7/27/21. With like 10 days prior to that where I woke up insanely sweaty and nauseous and out of it (my neuro said it's likely I had a lot of partial seizures). I am immediately put on Oxcarbazapine (trileptal) because of the number of events I had. I do have recurring partial seizures/auras monthly still.

Here is what's happening to me. 

Since seizure and starting trileptal, my mood and emotional state were the first thing I noticed. I would get overstimulated way easier and it would put me into severe crying episodes, couldn't stop myself, and had to call into work. I would start off irritated, it would turn to almost rage, then into bawling. They happened a couple days, then I felt normal for a while. Now I have noticed that it happens just periodically. If I had to estimate, maybe 3-4 days a month? I also feel exhausted the next day after this. 

Last night, it happened again after a very minor argument with my husband. Irritated first from being overstimulated, then a short rage where I said ""just shut up""to him. This is a big deal because I've NEVER said ""shut up"" to him, ever, in 6 years. Then I snapped out of the anger, got scared that I acted like that, and had a severe panicking cry episode. It made me write this. 

 Memory is SO bad I am even having trouble remembering if I took my trileptal after I have had it in my hand. Or, my pill alarm goes off, I'm busy, I have forgotten within 5 minutes until the second alarm goes off. I have 3 alarms and still take them late sometimes. This is the easiest example, but the memory is SO BAD I can't even think of any more examples at the moment. 

Getting interrupted when I am focused on something is usually a minor inconvenience, but now, it's like I am completely thrown off and am lost. Like a child.  My husband asked me ""I thought you were going to do ___"" And it threw off my imagined ""routine"" so bad that whatever focus I had on cleaning was gone and I was instantly lost, recalculating, bit failing to get back on track. 

Last- overstimulation. Crowds used to be just uncomfortable for me. Now I can't hardly be in them. Lights hurt, sounds are amplified, anxiety skyrockets. Textures bother me more than before. Severely. Basically, all the things that ""bothered"" me before are amplified and make me want to crawl out of my skin. 

Writing this out, I feel so ridiculous, but I am hoping someone out there understands what I'm trying to say and maybe it resonates with them too. This has all been since my seizure. Did epilepsy make my other issues worse or the trileptal?? Who knows."

Hello there! So I've been suffering with sinusitis on one side of my head for the past 4 years. I've seen many gps, doctors but no one ever took me seriously. ""you're young! there's nothing wrong with you. It's just stress"". That's what I've been hearing for the past years and I'm sick of it. I have all the symptoms - pain around the eye, neck, ear, runny or stuffed nostril etc. They did a CT scan two years ago and couldn't see anything, so they sent me home. However, I just know this is not normal so I finally managed to make one doctor to refer me for an MRI scan of my head. Do you think that is going to be helpful? Can doctors actually see the chronic infection there? Or for what scans/tests should I ask for to finally get a treatment? I can't live like this anymore. Thank you so much"

Ultrasound Thyroid -
There up to 2 x small nodules in the thyroid, a spongiform nodule in the left lobe measuring 6mm and a colloid cyst measuring 6x4mm in the right lobe. Both have characteristics of grade U2.

\-I have a history of allergies. I was tested two years ago and I'm pretty much allergic to everything. 

\-The symptoms I'm experiencing started maybe two months ago. I live in the Southeastern US, so near the beginning of fall. 

\-I have intermittent pain behind my left eye (I do get migraines), left temple, left top of head, left side of the bridge of my nose, and sometimes my left upper teeth. When I say intermittent, I mean it can last for ten minutes, two hours, disappear, come back, etc. 

\-I do not have a runny nose or any visible congestion. HOWEVER, when these symptoms happen, my left nostril is clogged completely. It can then be unclogged or no reason. For example, I was just watching a movie with my daughter a few minutes ago. I had the head and teeth discomfort (and clogged nostril) at the beginning, and then it just kind of went away and I could breathe fine. I noticed the symptoms went away, too. By the end of the movie, the clogged nostril and symptoms had returned.

Hi HHers! Im a 21F, suffering from hyperhidrosis on my palm and feet. They will be wet but not to the point of dripping. Ive recently purchased my first iontophoresis device (from a local brand and not the big brands) and started the treatment for a while. 

I followed the instructions and did it on both my hands and feet for 30 min each everyday, switching polarity in between. Voltage wise, Ive turned it up to my max tolerance. The instructions also said to use only tap water, which I did, but I live in a country with moderately soft water.

I did this for 2 weeks during the initial phase and found my hands and feet to be dry so I went on to the maintenance phase and did it for 4x a week. Coincidentally, the weather became warmer during my maintenance phase and my sweating came back So Im not sure if I was fully dry or was it due to the colder weather.

I contacted the CS and was advised to go back to the initial phase till my desired dryness before proceeding to maintenance. Ive been on the initial phase again for 2 weeks now and Im still sweating (especially when im playing mobile games). The center of my palms and feet are quite dry, the sweating mainly occur at the side and on my fingers/toes.

2. Is it normal for the side of the palms/feet and the fingers/toes to take longer?

3. Ive also seen many reddit posts about SP water and Im wondering if I should invest it that? The instructions said to use only tap water and its from a local brand so I thought it wouldve worked. Should I give it a shot? If so, do you mix it with tap water or just SP on its own?

So I decided to give it a go with hypnotherapy. For the moment I've done 2 sessions and feel no difference. But I'm not surprised cos I've been having HH for 30 or 40 years!! I heard that some younger people got rid of HH or lessen the effects of it after just 1 or 2 hypnosis sessions.

So I searched for an alternative and came across **trospium chloride**. It is an anticholinergic drug that acts just as glycopyrrolate and oxybutynin but it (almost ?) doesn't cross the BBB and doesn't have any effect on cognition or the CNS because of its chemical properties (low lipophilicity as a quaternary amine). However, I haven't found a single scientific study about the efficacy of this drug on HH. It has only been tested for incontinence. And I have checked its mechanism of action, it's the same as the 2 others:  it competes with acetylcholine by binding to the M1,M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors.

I had RAI in July 2021 (after two surgeries) as treatment for BRAF3600E PTC. No extensions/mets. The scan one week after my dose looked good and I have been waiting for the ~6-month follow up scan appointment. The radiologist called me this weekend to suggest an ultrasound as opposed to an iodine scan - he said the literature is trending this way for cases not considered high-risk for recurrence. 

I have mixed feelings - the health care system here (Canada) drags slowly so I would like to advocate for the best treatment as early as I can. However, foregoing LID and thyrogen shots would be great.

In 2019, I started getting nauseous more and more as time went on. Went to the doctor and did tests for months until they settled on saying it was my gallbladder.

The specialist more or less just told me to deal with it, so I went out of state to see if there was any other kind of treatment since there really isn't an active GI program in my own. They gave me a SmartPill, something that picks up things that any of the other tests I had don't. The insurance deemed it as ""experimental and unnecessary"" but the doctor disagreed so he got the financial department of the hospital on board and they tested me free of charge.

I just met with one of the doctors to go over the results and they told me my SBTT (small bowel transfer time) was slow but other than that, no gastroparesis, everything else was within range. In other words, I get constipated in such a way that my stomach empties but my bowels don't, only giving leeway just a little at a time, making me backed up and feel sick. They put me on a drug called Linzess, which is supposed to regulate you, we'll see where it goes from there but I wanted to share my experience for other people with similar feelings.

I want to share my experience of participating in active surveillance trial. Long story short: my 1.4 cm nodule was first time detected in 2013, in 2020 a biopsy and ultrasound were performed - Bethesda 6, PTC, 1.4 cm. In 2021 I singed up for active surveillance and had two follow-up visits in July, 2021 and January, 2022. [That's](https://imgur.com/a/rvk8HhI) how my cancerous nodule looked in 2021 and 2022.

In July on the first ultrasound the size was 0.9 cm.

I was extremely excited about the change in the nodule size. I came to see my ENDO, she did another ultrasound and said that it's so weird - the nodule is around 1cm. The next month I visited my parents in Ukraine (currently I live in California) where my problem was first detected in 2013, asked the same clinic to do the US and the nodule was... 1.4 cm. I realized that the image on US highly depends on people and devices. And it's unlikely that my work with my therapist can somehow affect cancer :)

In January on the first US the size was 1.2 cm and ""a new lymph node is present on the right side. Malignant involvement cannot be excluded"".

I was down at first and waiting for a week for the ENDO appointment was awfully hard. My ENDO did US by herself said that the spread is highly unlikely and it's an obvious mistake.

So, I had a total of 7 US in a year and a couple months. It taught me not to get attached to good results and not to fear bad (that's Buddhism, right?). Just live my life, be grateful for it and seeing some beauty in lessons we all get from cancer. I feel that I'm well prepared for all the years of active surveillance I (hopefully!) have ahead."

I'm starting to think between Mucinex and the neti pot that I'm washing away all the mucus that's supposed to protect my sinuses and now they get irritated by any particles that normally would get stuck in the mucus.

I'm testing my theory by cutting out the neti pot and tapering off Mucinex. I no longer really feel sick... I just have pressure and headaches from my sinuses getting inflamed some of the time.

This is the first study that links chronic sinus inflammation with a neurobiological change, said lead author Dr. Aria Jafari, a surgeon and assistant professor of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

It broadly impacts their quality of life. Now we have a prospective mechanism for what we observe clinically.

So I had a cavity induced sinus infection last February. It was the first sinus infection I have ever had and man it was a doozy. Sinus headaches so strong I could barely work. Gnarly green phlegm that made it hard to sleep. All just in my left nostril and sinuses. I had a deviated septum on that side as well where my nose got broken so that did not help. After a brief bout of antibiotics knocked the infection down enough that my head stopped hurting thats where the fun began. No matter what antibiotics I took it did not stop leaking green phlegm or being stuffed up. I took steroid sprays and decongestants. I finally started taking colloidal silver spray (sovereign) and it helped a little bit but it was the best I had at that point. Then just about a month ago I started to get serious and annoyed at this crap and started to do some more research. I bought some Betadine (10% iodine solution) and started doing nasal rinses with a Neil med bottle. 7ml (I used a syringe to measure) per bottle along with 1/4tsp of salt and baking powder made a difference in the volume of snot and the level of blockage. It seemed to help settle things down for a bit. Then I found out about xylitol from this subreddit. After
Trying 1/2tsp of xylitol to one bottle of the Neil med and noticing some obvious changes but then it seemed like it stopped I went on the internet and searched and found the original research and saw that the researchers used a 11% solution. So that is about 26.4g per 240ml bottle. 1/2tsp is about 4g. The next day I used 11 grams (math error) and was surprised at how clear my nose was. The next time (rinsed twice a day) I used 25g of xylitol along with the usual salt and baking soda and have for about 3 days now. Its basically night and day. If You are suffering from biofilms do this now. I feel like most instructions online say to use way too little. This is money. Also I used about 5-6 drops of grapefruit seed extract. Could be helping as it is a known antibiotic. AMA"

Hi all

Thought I would give you a quick update. This will be mainly for UK sufferers. I have just had a Dermatology Appointment for hyperhidrosis and they have agreed to prescribe me glycopyrrolate so I no longer have to buy this from the internet.

Originally he wanted me to try oxy but I explained that I had done my research and knew that oxy crossed the blood brain barrier and the links that has to dementia. Once he could see that I knew my stuff and that glycopyrrolate is already working for me he said he would prescribe it for me. He was hesitant because it costs the UK a lot of money but they will prescribe it if you plead your case.

I couldn't be happier with this result and this will save me a lot of money at a time where money is tight for everyone.

Please feel free to ask questions."

So I recently went to see 2 GIs. One prescribed me Motegrity because Ive been struggling with severe constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, gas, bloating, acid reflux, extremely early satiety and loss of appetite, malabsorption, and undigested food in stools. Since having all the symptoms of GP, he bypassed a GES and went straight to putting me on motegrity and prevacid. I guess my question is, should I push for a GES? its pretty clear that I have slow motility and digestion because of all my symptoms, and I want a GES just to see the rate ate which things are moving, but I fear that it will come back normal and Ill be back to the drawing board because of that. I know false positives and negatives are common with the GES, so I am wondering if there is a better test for this.

I saw an article about this woman, also 30 and who also got the vax last year. Her doctors actually figured out that she got her cancer a year before the lump emerged and that because of the side effects of the vax, it got the cancer to show up years before it wouldve normally.

Hello everyone!

Ive suffered from excessive sweating from my underarms for about 5 or 6 years now. Up until recently, Thompson Tees were my best friend as they at least stopped the sweat from showing through my shirts. I started getting tired of being so sweaty though and the wetness feeling. So I tried out CertainDri. 

I first put it on last Wednesday. I still sweat some on Thursday, but after putting it on again Thursday night, I didnt sweat at all on Friday. I put it on again Friday night, skipped Saturday night, and put it on again last night. I havent sweat from my underarms since Friday, and I have been able to freely go out without feeling the need to wear a Thompson Tee (though I keep one in my car just in case). Its literally been life changing and I just hope it continues working.

There is a little stinging at first but you get accustomed to it. I would emphasize that when using these types of antiperspirants, make sure you follow their directions to the letter, or else it may not work completely.

this might be weird but it just occurred to me.

I keep reading a lot of people with ADHD and other mental health stuff have trouble with emotional regulation. I can relate to that in a lot of ways but one thing I noticed is that I never get angry.

Like, obviously I get sorta annoyed and pissed off but I never yell at anyone, never argue, never lash out, etc. I think it started years ago because I felt like once I fall out with someone I can never be friends with them again so I got very conflict avoidant. I'm 30 now and I still never say anything when something bothers me for fear of them ""leaving"" me when I complain.

I'm wondering if that's unhealthy. I used to let it out on myself but now I just... get mad on the inside but then go numb. I've noticed I'm numb a lot. I don't feel any emotions towards anything or anyone, other than constantly being overwhelmed at work. I also forgot what it feels like to love someone (I've been single largely by choice for 6 years and have never had any really close friends). if I do feel them, they're usually so intense I can barely take them (for example, I sometimes care about people so much it makes me cry).

Ive been scrolling through this sub for some time and am glad to see how everyone encourages, educates and support one another. Its been probably around 2 years since lurking the sub and collecting information on how to handle hyperhidrosis. 

Some information about me:
- 24 yo, male
- Had this condition since age 15/16
- Currently full body sweating (compensatory)
- Alcohol causes sweating

These are the methods Ive carried out & the respective results:

- Oxybutynin > Little to no results, but may be due to low strength/infrequent intake
- Drysol > Has completely eliminated arm pit sweat, but caused compensatory sweating (groin/hands/feet)
- Gold Bond > Effective for probably 1-2 hours
- Casual Deodorant > smells nice and holds more than 24 hours
- Glycolic acid > Just started using this

My sweating seems to come and go. Anxiety/confined rooms being a major driving force. (Dont sweat around family for example)

Despite all of this, due to previous comments about body odour, Im quite anxious of smelling bad. I put great effort into my hygiene, but cant forget the comments from the past. Im going to consult a doctor and therapist to get through this, but have some questions on the issue.

- How do you guys stop your room from smelling due to sweat?
- Are there any other products Im unaware of that can reduce full body sweat?
- Does anyone else smell badly around the groin/feet?

Is cyclic vomiting actually related to gp from anyone's experience or someone with better understanding of the possible symptoms than me know ? 


She gets full quickly and sometimes overfull.  Which I see is common here.  But does that fullness feeling trigger multiple hours after eating, delayed.  She also feels a pinch/cramp sensation during these episodes usually at the end.

I've read the bullet points on general things to stay away from but again just curious in the communities experiences

Any activity or post eating ritual you have that helps with stomach emptying?  It's starting to snow here and concerned our window for easy light walking is closing for a few months.

Is smoking weed helpful to symptoms for any of you guys?  She has stopped until we talk with the GI specialist but I feel like marajuana is still so stigmatized and politicized that some people may say it's harmful when it could be the opposite.

I've notice a lot of people treating the use of cinnamon as means of increasing insulin sensitivity as a kind of joke. I would like to offer an alternative experience.

I am T1 (for about 35 years). My blood sugar is well controlled almost all the time. My insulin sensitivity is extremely high- these days, I often take only 10 units a day- and very seldom more than 20 a day (and that's only when I deliberately increase it to make weights training more effective). And I'm 6'3 and weigh 84kg (about 12 % BF).

Taking cinnamon is one of the oldest supplements for bodybuilding (not specifically for diabetics), because increased insulin sensitivity means less fat deposits and more protein synthesis. See: https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/tip-add-cinnamon-to-your-meals/?nowprocket=1


I have found cinnamon really does wonders for improved insulin sensitivity. But you have to actually EAT it in a meaningful quantity, and not just sprinkle a little on your food- like several full teaspoonfuls of it a day. 

Please, don't be hasty to condemn this as a supplement before trying it properly."

Got diagnosed with invasive PTC with lymphovascular invasion.

Will Botox help me?
Hi all,

New to reddit so excuse if I mess any of this up. I'm 25M and I had ETS surgery done back in May 2021 for severe blushing that i've experienced for as long as I can remember. The surgeon I saw was based in London and he does one side of the surgery at a time. I've only had the right hand side done. Around 1 month after the surgery I started getting this feeling of intense heat and sweating on the right side (the operated side) of my face and scalp. The sweat is concentrated on my scalp and the right hand side of my forehead and is only triggered by food. All I have to do is think about eating a hot meal and the tingling feeling of sweat will start. I have to use over 5 napkins throughout each meal and it's completely ruining my life. I have been seeing a autonomic nerve specialist and for the time being she has prescribed me topical glycopyrrolate which I apply each morning to the right hand side of my forehead. This is working to an extent on my forehead, but obviously is not doing anything for my scalp so I am still roasting hot and drenched in sweat whenever I eat ANYTHING.

I'm now at a stage where I'm desperate and I'm very close to getting Botox injections in my scalp and forehead to help with the gustatory sweating. I've read online that for some reason botox works a lot better on gustatory sweating than other types of hyperhidrosis. This is going to cost me £750 every 3 to 4 months which is madness, but I feel like its worth it to not have to live like this. 

I'd appreciate anyone's input on the impact of botox on gustatory sweating, and if anyone has experienced gustatory sweating as a result of ETS :)"

Results? Recovery? Worth it? - Thoughts about ENS (Empty Nose Syndrome)
I'm a 20 year old male. Height: 186cm. Weight: 96kg. From the middle east. I've had a congested nose for as long as I can remember. I've underwent septoplasty, but that didn't help with shit. Now my doctor recommends that I undergo some surgery called radiofrequency turbinate reduction. My clogged nose has caused me extreme misery over my years. I'm 20 years now. I can't even talk with people without having to constantly gasp for air after every sentence. I'm also about to start studying in a university, but I'm worried I'll probably feel like total crap and just leave everything because of my current condition. So, I'm thinking ill give this RF thing a try. Is there anyone who has done this RF thing? I really want to do it, but all these stories of ENS (Empty Nose Syndrome) has scared the living shit out of me. Some doctors claim that in order to get ENS, one must be very aggressive with the resection of the turbinates, or completely remove them, where as others claim that you can only remove part of it and get ENS. Is there anyone who has gotten this RF surgery done? If so, what was it like? Recovery? Results? I just want to be able to be social, talk, eat, sleep and just do everything that a normal person is able to do. This shit has really gotten to me, and it's gotten to the point where I'm constantly riddled with anxiety due to my bullshit breathing. Even started feeling like I'm suffocating last year. It was extremely bad for about 4 months, then it settled down a bit but I still feel the need to have deep breathes constantly. Also feel out of breath /unable to take deep breaths. Done an EKG, Spirometry, CT scan of my chest & lungs and also had a normal lung X-ray. All results were normal, so the doctor really suspected that all this is caused by anxiety. I was given betablockers for my high blood pressure though. My nose having been clogged for eternity just makes it worse. I'm 20 years but on so many meds I've lost count. It's come to the point where I feel like complete shit. So again, please, those who have underwent radiofrequency turbinate reduction, or know people who have, please tell me about the surgery and the results etc etc. I'd like to start by at least being able to breathe with my nose so I can start improving everything else. I've been using nasal decongestant sprays on and off for about a year, now I've built up a tolerance so that's fucking me up as well. Again, please anyone who could just tell me about this if they've done it? Anything helps.

This website recommends Reishi and Shiitake: [https://hifasdaterra.co.uk/clinic/sinusitis/](https://hifasdaterra.co.uk/clinic/sinusitis/) I have not yet tried these. Reishi is a psychedelic while Shiitake is not.

\-**Diet** is another big one. Some people say it completely cured them when they removed dairy, gluten, processed sugars while others say it just made them feel better. I have been experimenting with this and I have noticed that eating chocolate makes my symptoms almost unbearable if I have enough. I bought brownies from Costco and forced myself to eat a 3-4 a day for a few days and by day 3 my symptoms had gotten as bad as they have gotten. Gluten and bread doesn't actually seem to have an affect but dairy does seem to make it worse. The worst thing of all is definitely chocolate though.

**-Nasal Spray** is what my doctor and I think most will prescribe right away for Sinusitis. While it has helped my symptoms by reducing the pressure substantially it is by no means a cure and has caused some frustrations and negative feelings between my doctor and I. She feels I should just keep taking this even though it seems to be doing nothing now (it reduced my pressure from april-may but since then I've had the same levels of pressure it feels and there has been no progress), while I feel she should be referring me to an ENT to get to the root of the problem.

*Routines to reduce symptoms:*

\-**Neilmed rinse**: This like many people have pointed out helps a lot, when I first started I would do it 2-3 times a day but now I do it once every few days and get the same benefits. It is different for everyone so keep doing it as much as it makes you feel better.

\-**Exercise:** While I am exercising the pressure in my head and temples gets a lot worse but if I am able to get through a solid workout I usually feel better afterwards for about 3-4 hours.

\-**Ginger Tea**: I have been drinking strong ginger tea a few times a week in the morning and that seems to help a little ... it tastes disgusting but with some honey its not so bad.

\-**Water:** Drink plenty of water is commonly recommended as it thins mucus

\-**Hot Showers**: Similar to using steam to open sinuses, hot showers makes me feel a bit better for a few hours. I do not have a gym membership but one with a dry sauna, I would imagine would help greatly.

\-**Humidifier:** This is something worth looking into as well, if the air around you is too dry it leads to sinus issues so using a humidifier to add moisture in the air around you may help

\-**Garlic, Apple Cider Vinegar**: A lot of people have recommended shoving garlic up your nose or putting some apple cider vinegar in your nasal rinse (Neilmed) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/msldem/sinus\_rinse\_with\_apple\_cider\_vinegar\_cured\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/msldem/sinus_rinse_with_apple_cider_vinegar_cured_my/)

However, this is one practice I do NOT recommend. I talked to 2 separate doctors about it and they said you should not do either as doing these things can cause further damage. I also did stuff the garlic up my nose and while it did lead to a little discharge I did not feel much better and my nose was irritated for the next week.

\-**Mushrooms**, I had a microdose in May and tons of mucus came out within 2 hours of taking a tiny amount and since that day I have had very little discharge. And I felt great for about a day or two. This website recommends Reishi and Shiitake: [https://hifasdaterra.co.uk/clinic/sinusitis/](https://hifasdaterra.co.uk/clinic/sinusitis/) I have not yet tried these. Reishi is a psychedelic while Shiitake is not.

\-**Diet** is another big one. Some people say it completely cured them when they removed dairy, gluten, processed sugars while others say it just made them feel better. I have been experimenting with this and I have noticed that eating chocolate makes my symptoms almost unbearable if I have enough. I bought brownies from Costco and forced myself to eat a 3-4 a day for a few days and by day 3 my symptoms had gotten as bad as they have gotten. Gluten and bread doesn't actually seem to have an affect but dairy does seem to make it worse. The worst thing of all is definitely chocolate though.

**-Nasal Spray** is what my doctor and I think most will prescribe right away for Sinusitis. While it has helped my symptoms by reducing the pressure substantially it is by no means a cure and has caused some frustrations and negative feelings between my doctor and I. She feels I should just keep taking this even though it seems to be doing nothing now (it reduced my pressure from april-may but since then I've had the same levels of pressure it feels and there has been no progress), while I feel she should be referring me to an ENT to get to the root of the problem.

*Routines to reduce symptoms:*

\-**Neilmed rinse**: This like many people have pointed out helps a lot, when I first started I would do it 2-3 times a day but now I do it once every few days and get the same benefits. It is different for everyone so keep doing it as much as it makes you feel better.

\-**Exercise:** While I am exercising the pressure in my head and temples gets a lot worse but if I am able to get through a solid workout I usually feel better afterwards for about 3-4 hours.

\-**Ginger Tea**: I have been drinking strong ginger tea a few times a week in the morning and that seems to help a little ... it tastes disgusting but with some honey its not so bad.

\-**Water:** Drink plenty of water is commonly recommended as it thins mucus

\-**Hot Showers**: Similar to using steam to open sinuses, hot showers makes me feel a bit better for a few hours. I do not have a gym membership but one with a dry sauna, I would imagine would help greatly.

\-**Humidifier:** This is something worth looking into as well, if the air around you is too dry it leads to sinus issues so using a humidifier to add moisture in the air around you may help

\-**Garlic, Apple Cider Vinegar**: A lot of people have recommended shoving garlic up your nose or putting some apple cider vinegar in your nasal rinse (Neilmed) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/msldem/sinus\_rinse\_with\_apple\_cider\_vinegar\_cured\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/msldem/sinus_rinse_with_apple_cider_vinegar_cured_my/)

However, this is one practice I do NOT recommend. I talked to 2 separate doctors about it and they said you should not do either as doing these things can cause further damage. I also did stuff the garlic up my nose and while it did lead to a little discharge I did not feel much better and my nose was irritated for the next week.

For everyone on Adderall --- have the effects tapered a ton for you? I was just diagnosed and prescribed adderall. My husband has had ADHD for 20 years and has been on and off adderall twice. I got misdiagnosed with depression and given SSRIs in my 20s ... I tried a bunch of different ones from 20 to 30 and they all just made me sleep all day and not care about anything. I almost failed out of college on Prozac. I finally gave up and just dealt with it until my newest therapist told me to see a neuropsych about ADHD vs. Mood disorder and they diagnoised me with ADHD. 

I was just prescribed Adderall and I feel calm and productive for the first time in my life. I can even sleep! All the internal rambling is so quiet. 

However,  my husband has been on it 6 years and keeps telling me it won't last and he's trying to get off it. He keeps telling me to think really hard about starting. 

We are extremely different, but it's made me really scared to keep going with the medication. He is the kind of person that takes a drug and seems high to everyone but says he doesn't feel high at all. Even his optometrist told him he ""eats prescription"" because no matter what he says the higher one looks better. Haha. I wish I was making that up.

So, I don't know. I'm curious everyone's experience. I hope to use the adderall to make good life style changes as well, so I'm not dependent on it ... but my husband has made me scared of the long term."

Hi all! 

I'll be seeing my endo on Thursday, but I already have the results of my recent tg and anti-tg blood tests and I would like some insight from you guys beforehand. My unstimulated TG levels are <0.20 (undetectable, my stimulated TG levels were 0.72 six months ago and unstimulated TG levels were also <0.20 a year ago). My TG antibodies levels are 23 (they were <15, so undetectable, six months ago). What are the implications that my TG antibodies levels are now detectable? I read that it could mess with the results of my TG levels, but I also read that you're not really supposed to have TG antibodies. Would love if someone could share their knowledge/experiences with this :)

Btw, I'm on a very suppressed dose of Thyrax, so my TSH is really really low (0.030). And I'm from the Netherlands, so I don't know if the measurements correspond to other countries' measurements."

so im on a family plan with a 3k/6k out of pocket expense, I think it's hdhp with a hsa that my husband employer contributes a bit too.

was orginally taking metformin but it's horrible and over the past 2 months it's been making me sick as a dog so I asked my endocrinologist can I go on something else. she recommended ozempic since alot of patients responded well to it, lost weight, and had a good effect on their sugar. plus it's taken only weekly in which sounds great for someone like me since I'm not the best with keeping up with medications. back in December since we had hit our 6k deductible I had paid nothing  when I recieced the medication so I had no clue what the actual price would be but I nearly had a heart attack when I tried picking it up in the store recently...with my plan I'm at 800 bucks for the thing and optum informed me it's 2300 (1981 with the discount card) for a 90 day supply. that's ALOT  of money...I was going to purchase farxiga today with optum (1500 dollars) but literally don't have the money to afford to do so..my car needs a new catalytic converter so finacially I had to make the cut to my medication (my cardiologist put me on that to prevent heart failure since I have ""resistant hypertension"" that's not responding well medication)

i made a joke to my husband and said I may have to divorce him just so I qualify for that government health insurance. hell looking at it now I may be serious! as a diabetic or anyone in America on any type of medication  how are ppl able to afford their insulin/pills/machines/ whatever. our household income is around 85k so there's not much assistance we can get that im aware of"

\-**Garlic, Apple Cider Vinegar**: A lot of people have recommended shoving garlic up your nose or putting some apple cider vinegar in your nasal rinse (Neilmed) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/msldem/sinus\_rinse\_with\_apple\_cider\_vinegar\_cured\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/msldem/sinus_rinse_with_apple_cider_vinegar_cured_my/)

However, this is one practice I do NOT recommend. I talked to 2 separate doctors about it and they said you should not do either as doing these things can cause further damage. I also did stuff the garlic up my nose and while it did lead to a little discharge I did not feel much better and my nose was irritated for the next week.

Different people seem to have completely different medications or procedures that help them, I am just compiling them and then I will go through them one by one until I feel like a normal human being again. I have been dealing with chronic sinusitis and dizzyiness/vertigo for 8 months.

*Below are a list of solutions*, I have found online or on this subreddit:

\-The big one is **surgery** if doctors deem it the right decision seems to help a high % of people. This is what my province has to say about it: [https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/tb1888](https://www.healthlinkbc.ca/health-topics/tb1888)

**-NAC (N-acetyl-cysteine)** was mentioned in another post and the poster said it cured their chronic sinus problems: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/pdl4vt/nac\_nacetylcysteine\_just\_cured\_my\_chronic\_sinus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/pdl4vt/nac_nacetylcysteine_just_cured_my_chronic_sinus/)

\-Another is **Serrapeptase** which was from a post on this subreddit as well: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/kqa60a/chronic\_sinusitis\_cured/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/kqa60a/chronic_sinusitis_cured/)

If ct scan shows nothing (no polyps), this seems to be a solid option

\-**Mushrooms**, I had a microdose in May and tons of mucus came out within 2 hours of taking a tiny amount and since that day I have had very little discharge. And I felt great for about a day or two. This website recommends Reishi and Shiitake: [https://hifasdaterra.co.uk/clinic/sinusitis/](https://hifasdaterra.co.uk/clinic/sinusitis/) I have not yet tried these. Reishi is a psychedelic while Shiitake is not.

\-**Diet** is another big one. Some people say it completely cured them when they removed dairy, gluten, processed sugars while others say it just made them feel better. I have been experimenting with this and I have noticed that eating chocolate makes my symptoms almost unbearable if I have enough. I bought brownies from Costco and forced myself to eat a 3-4 a day for a few days and by day 3 my symptoms had gotten as bad as they have gotten. Gluten and bread doesn't actually seem to have an affect but dairy does seem to make it worse. The worst thing of all is definitely chocolate though.

**-Nasal Spray** is what my doctor and I think most will prescribe right away for Sinusitis. While it has helped my symptoms by reducing the pressure substantially it is by no means a cure and has caused some frustrations and negative feelings between my doctor and I. She feels I should just keep taking this even though it seems to be doing nothing now (it reduced my pressure from april-may but since then I've had the same levels of pressure it feels and there has been no progress), while I feel she should be referring me to an ENT to get to the root of the problem. Some possible ways of increasing nasal spray effectiveness: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/mfu7a5/often\_times\_when\_we\_use\_nasal\_sprays\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/mfu7a5/often_times_when_we_use_nasal_sprays_the/)

*Routines to reduce symptoms:*

\-**Neilmed rinse**: This like many people have pointed out helps a lot, when I first started I would do it 2-3 times a day but now I do it once every few days and get the same benefits. It is different for everyone so keep doing it as much as it makes you feel better.

\-**Exercise:** While I am exercising the pressure in my head and temples gets a lot worse but if I am able to get through a solid workout I usually feel better afterwards for about 3-4 hours.

\-**Ginger Tea**: I have been drinking strong ginger tea a few times a week in the morning and that seems to help a little ... it tastes disgusting but with some honey its not so bad.

\-**Water:** Drink plenty of water is commonly recommended as it thins mucus

\-**Hot Showers**: Similar to using steam to open sinuses, hot showers makes me feel a bit better for a few hours. I do not have a gym membership but one with a dry sauna, I would imagine would help greatly.

\-**Humidifier:** This is something worth looking into as well, if the air around you is too dry it leads to sinus issues so using a humidifier to add moisture in the air around you may help

\-**Garlic, Apple Cider Vinegar**: A lot of people have recommended shoving garlic up your nose or putting some apple cider vinegar in your nasal rinse (Neilmed) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/msldem/sinus\_rinse\_with\_apple\_cider\_vinegar\_cured\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/msldem/sinus_rinse_with_apple_cider_vinegar_cured_my/)

My partner has papillary thyroid cancer, and had a total thyroidectomy in September. In addition to 4 cm node, an additional smaller node was found on other side. Only one lymph node was removed during surgery because surgeon said they all looked normal. Cancer was detected in this lymph node and ENT surgeon said this indicated a good chance that it may be present in other lymph nodes. 

Ever since this pathology came back, the ENT surgeon and endocrinologist have consistently said that RAI would definitely be the next step. Nobody ever questioned whether this was necessary since there is lymph node involvement - until an endo appointment last week (with Endo 1) where a different endocrinologist (Endo 2) in this clinic overheard details, and took them to yet another endo colleague who apparently specializes in thyroid cancer (Endo 3 - not sure why we werent seeing her the whole time?!), who is now saying RAI isnt worth the risk. Endo 3 couldnt see us because of scheduling, but Endo 2 interrupted the appointment with Endo 1 to basically say no, no RAI, the specialist thinks it isnt necessary. It was pretty jarring, since this is the first weve heard this and weve never met Endo 2 or 3.

The explanation was theres only one lymph node involved, and it was removed. But we cant figure out why finding cancer in the only one removed could possibly indicate it couldnt be in any others. Theyve scheduled an ultrasound for this week, but an ultrasound didnt show the second thyroid node nor the one confirmed lymph node pre-surgery anyways, so Im not sure how much to rely on that. RAI is still scheduled for the end of the month but it sounds like theyll cancel it if they dont find indicators of more lymph node/neck involvement. All this despite my partner very much wanting the treatment for peace of mind.

I would love to hear from anyone who may have some insight. I dont want to dismiss the risks (mostly leukemia, partner is not worried about others), but this whole situation has been so odd and I want to support with as much info as I can. Thanks in advance!"
t5_vqneh,tfjegg,I read a lot of reports from others on Reddit and I knew how bad the recovery could be.,"[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","My sinus surgery experience (a detailed daily report)
Hey guys, Im a 30-year-old British male currently living in Thailand.

Ive always had trouble breathing out of my nose, especially at night. I spent the last 15 years taking over-the-counter nasal sprays like Sinex and Afrin on a near-daily basis. Late last year, I finally decided to fix my breathing so I can sleep better and improve the general quality of my life.

I went to multiple ENTs for advice and it turns out I have a number of problems; a deviated septum, nasal polyps, enlarged turbinates, and a lingering sinus infection. I spent several months trying different medications to fix it without surgery, but nothing had any lasting impact.

With surgery now being the last option, I was told I needed the following procedures done:  


* A septoplasty to straighten my deviated septum
* A turbinectomy to reduce the size of my turbinates
* a polypectomy to remove two small polys
* Sinus surgery (or FESS) to connect/widen my sinuses 

My insurance wouldnt pay for it as I was only covered for emergencies and this was clearly a preexisting condition, so I paid out of pocket. Total cost was 130,000 baht, which is around $4,000 USD at the time of writing.

Heres how it all went:

**Day 1 - Surgery day**

I was anxious. I read a lot of reports from others on Reddit and I knew how bad the recovery could be. I didnt sleep well the night before but woke up feeling ready to take the whole thing head-on.

They prepped me, wheeled me into the surgery room, and moved me to the surgery table. I was still conscious at this point and it was weird seeing all the prep being done around me, and all the equipment they would use. In the UK, youre usually knocked out way before this point.

After about 10 minutes of staring at the operating room ceiling, the anesthetist asked me if I was ready, I said I was, he lowered the mask onto my face and I dont even remember it making contact. Lights out.

I woke up in the recovery room, seemingly instantly. The pain hit my face immediately, as did my extremely sore/dry throat. I called out for morphine and some water and was given both. The morphine provided immediate pain relief but also made me nauseous.

Shortly later, I was taken back to my room where I would spend the night on a drip, under the watch of several nurses.

**Day 2 - Blood. Lots of blood.**

I spent most of the night groaning in pain and general discomfort. You have to sleep fully elevated and you can only breathe out of your mouth. They place mustache padding under your nose to collect blood, and theres a LOT. The nurses replaced it frequently.

Unfortunately for me, I soon discovered that without any air being allowed through my nose, when I fall asleep, my tongue relaxes, blocks my airways, and jolts me back awake (AKA obstructive sleep apnea). This continued all night as I watched the clock move in 10-minute increments.

In the morning, the doctor came to my room to talk about how the surgery went. She said it was a long surgery, 3 hours, during which she made many adjustments. She told me I only had a single stint on the right nostril along with dissolvable packing as that side had a lot more work done, which I could definitely feel.

She also cleared me to go home despite having initially said I might have to spend 3 nights in the hospital. I wasnt going to argue with her, I hate hospital rooms. I spent the rest of the day settling back in at home, changing my nose padding frequently, and trying to remain as comfortable as possible.

**Day 3 - Lingering pain**

It was another sleepless night. No matter what positions I tried, the second I fell asleep my tongue would block my throat close and Id be instantly wake up again. It was incredibly frustrating and I gave up trying to sleep at around 4am.

The pain still hadnt subsided at this point. My head felt sore, like a deep throbbing sensation that never seemed to go away. Pain meds helped but I was always consciously aware of the trauma my nose and sinuses had been through. 

Aside from that, my nose kept bleeding throughout the day so I continued to change out my padding, clean the area of blood, take all my pills, etc. I also watched some Netflix when the pain wasnt too strong.

**Day 4 - The breakdown**

I experienced yet another sleepless night. I just couldnt stay asleep with my throat closing up. Everything just become too much for me at this point and without thinking, at around 1am, I sat up and screamed at the top of my lungs. I screamed so loud it triggered some bleeding. This sudden exertion of energy almost certainly extended my recovery process. And yes, I know, Im an idiot.

At this point, while fighting back tears, I remembered I had some valium (diazepam) leftover from a dental surgery last year. Even if all it did was calm me down, it was worth a shot. I swallowed the valium, took some deep breaths, and went back to bed.

By some miracle, I managed to fall asleep and stay asleep for several hours this time. The mouth snoring must have been incredible because I woke up with a very sore throat, but I was just relieved to have gotten any sleep at all.

The rest of the day I spent watching movies and doing much of the same post-op stuff mentioned on the previous days. Thankfully, the bleeding began slowing on this day and the sinus pain subsided so I stopped taking the pain meds.

By evening, I finally started using a Neti Pot and saline solution to flush out any old blood, and it forced out plenty of dark chunks. I used it once more before bed with similar results.

**Day 5 - The turning point**

I didnt take any chances the night before and decided to dose up on strong sleeping pills. I also slept a bit more horizontal than previous nights (fewer pillows). I got the most sleep since my surgery and woke up feeling pretty groggy from the pills. Still, a huge win on the sleep front. 

I changed my nose bandage as usual and noticed much less drainage compared to previous mornings. There was also a significant change in color. Less dark red/brown and more yellow discharge with a few specks of fresh blood. It felt like a turning point in my recovery and things would slowly start to get better from here.

For the rest of the day, I continued doing saline rinses every few hours to flush everything out. At some point, I could actually get a small amount of air through my left nostril. Not enough to breathe but it was something. My right nostril still had a splint and was very congested.

The only other notable change was my right ear popped (like being on a plane) during one of the saline rinses and stayed like that all day. I tried to unpop it in various ways but couldnt do much without sucking blood down my throat. It was annoying but tolerable.

**Day 6 - The follow-up**

Had the best night of sleep so far since the surgery, once again aided by pills. Woke up with minimal drainage in the mustache dressing and actually felt a lot of crusting for the first time in both nostrils.

I did a morning saline rinse to loosen everything up. This flushed out more old blood and felt great. Still, some pain in my right nostril where they cut the turbinate (the left side only had radiofrequency treatment).

I finally felt strong enough to go out and start doing normal people things. The pandemic actually worked in my favor here as I could wear my padding under my mask and nobody would ever know. I also did a bit of light work on the laptop (I run my own online business).

Later on, I had my follow-up appointment with the doctor. She said it all looked good and proceeded to vacuum out both nostrils. It was a little painful but not too bad. I could breathe a little better out of both sides after that but still not great. She said the silicone would not come out until next week's appointment.

The rest of the night was uneventful. Some yellow fluid continued to slowly ooze out of my nose every hour or so. I did another saline rinse before bed, padded myself up, and called it a night.

**Day 7 - Back to normality**

I continued to take sleeping pills as I could only get a tiny bit of air through my left nostril, and I still wore the mustache padding even though drainage was minimal. I also removed a pillow so I could sleep slightly more horizontally, and I continued to do this over the coming days.

Come morning, I slowly got back into my normal work routine and even met up with friends for lunch. There were frequent bathroom visits to clean up my nose but overall it wasnt too much of a hindrance.

I also used the neti pot morning and night as instructed by my doctor, though at this stage it felt like it did more harm than good as it always triggered fresh bleeding.

**Day 8 - More bleeding**

Just when I thought things could only get better, I woke up with huge amounts of blood coming from my right nostril (the left side completely stopped bleeding at this point).

This blood continued all day and was similar to the amount of blood I saw following the first few days after the surgery. I have no idea what caused this but perhaps it was just being up and about too soon.

I spent most of the day at home, cleaning my nose, changing my padding, doing saline rinses, and actually feeling pretty light-headed by the end of it.

**Day 9 - Feeling the pressure**

I woke up feeling a lot of pressure in my sinuses, particularly above my right eye. Over the course of the morning, this pressure became borderline painful and triggered a headache I just couldnt seem to shake.

It honestly felt a lot like being back at day 3 and I spent most of the day just lying on my bed, waiting for this episode to pass. I even managed to fall asleep and woke up feeling a bit better in the evening (pressure had mostly gone away).

My guess is that this is related to the sudden heavy bleeding yesterday and Im not having to go through some of the initial recovery processes again, at least to a degree. Very disappointing day.

**Days 10-12 - The gunk phase**

Im going to group these next few days together as changes were a lot more gradual.

I stopped sleeping with a mustache pad at this point. While I did have to cough up some blood that had dried in my throat overnight, nothing came out of the front door anymore so that was a big positive.

I call this the gunk phase because thats exactly what came out of my nose several times a day during my rinses. It was just a very sticky, yellow, puss-ey substance that never seemed to end, mixed in with the odd blood clot, of course.

I was determined to make the next few days highly productive, so I went straight back to work and put in several full days. Fortunately, I was now able to partially breathe through my left nostril.

**Day 13 - Splint removed**

This was the day I was most looking forward to since waking up from my surgery; getting that annoying silicone splint removed from my right nostril.

To my surprise, the removal was painless. I barely felt it coming out. I actually asked the doc if it was already out, and was confused when she confirmed it was. She then placed the same suction tool in my nose as last time to clean everything out.

I felt immediately better. It wasnt this mind-blowing difference that you often read from other experiences, but it was certainly the best I had felt since the surgery.

While I could now breathe through both nostrils without having to open my mouth for air, there was always a build-up of thick mucous building that could only be dealt with through saline rinses.

Overall, though, this was the best day yet by a long shot. 

**Week 3 - Feeling awesome**

I slept incredibly well from this point forward.

As the days went on, it was clear I was breathing through my nose far better than I ever could pre-op.

The quality of my sleep improved dramatically and I often found myself breathing entirely through my nose for several minutes which I never even attempted before.

I did make the mistake of pointing a flashlight up my nose to see how things were healing up, and it still looked like a crime scene up there.

Still, things can only get better, right?

**Week 4**

And thats where I am as of posting this.

Im now in the middle of week 4 and Im going to stop writing as I really feel the majority of my recovery is over. 

Everything has been slowly getting better and I can already tell this has been a life-changing decision.

If there are any significant updates I will post them here.

Thank you!"

Some info about me i live very clean, clean my nose a few times per day too.

I'm suspecting that my issue comes from me ""swallowing"" or whatever mucus because I get the reflex for it because the people I live with are disgusting as fuck and make disgusting sounds (like pulling up their mucus in nose, i dont know how it's called) or snoring etc. but mostly the former is my issue.

It leads me to get as swallowing reflex, could this be a cause for bacterial infection ?

I have been Avert for about 4 weeks now. I ordered the 1mg pills from pharmacy.ca, very expensive shipping(US) but very quick shipping.

I have had progressively worse sweating over the last 10 or so years. In most of my teens/20s I had no issues.  It was until my 30s the I started sweating, pits and head.  It had gotten to the point where I would be sweating doing nothing in a 65 degree house, having to wear dark clothes, hats, change clothes multiple times a day...  I hadn't tried much outside of extra strength deodorants, but decided to pull the trigger on the Avert.


I am extremely happy with it thus far.  The other day I sat on a plan for an hour and a half flight in pants and a puffy jacket without sweating, I sat through a 3 hour tattoo on my knee cap with out sweating(normally I'm a hot mess during tattoos), been able to wear shirts I haven't in a while.  In general I haven't felt the hot feeling take over my body right before I would start sweating.  Its been pretty great.


The first week I was taking 1mg in the morning and waiting 2 hours to eat.  I did not notice much of a decrease in sweating this week or any side effects(more on this later).  I kept my dose at 1mg the whole week.


The second week I decided to up it to 2mg in the morning(trying to take at 6 am to be able to eat breakfast before leaving the house), first day on 2mg I hardly had any sweat, it was an awesome day! The second day I ate just 45 minutes after taking 2mg and noticed I was sweating a bit more than the day before and have since allowed at least 1.5 hours between.  Around the end of week 2 I woke up with sore throat, that day I figured maybe I was getting a cold since its the PNW and the weather has gotten shitty.  The sore throat stayed around for 4/5 days accompanied by extreme dry mouth so bad I was drinking a 32oz bottle of water over the course of the night.  


Week 3 I upped it again to 3mg the first day which brought more dry mouth so I went back to 2mg and continued to drink a lot of water.  I continued to see pretty long periods with no sweating, towards the late afternoons early evening maybe a little, but nothing like it was before, barley noticeable in a dress shirt.


This last week I have stayed on 2mg, think this is the sweet spot for me.  I have stayed up on drinking water often and using throat lozenges which help the side effects, I have read that after a month or 2 they go away and I have hope they will since it seems they're getting less each week.  The day of the tattoo I took 1mg at 2 in the afternoon to see if that would change the late afternoon evening light sweat and found that worked, my appointment was at 4pm and I ended up being there till about 9pm, with no sweating in a shop that's usually pretty warm and and tattoo makes me sweat profusely!

All in all I am beyond pleased with Avert, I am hoping the success continues.  I am lookin in to MiraDry also as there is a place near me, just waiting to see if they offer and Black Friday specials, although I think most of us would pay much more than those treatments cost to cure sweating."

Hey all. I am an early 20s female, and was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer in August of this year. By the end of that same month, I got my total thyroidectomy.

Soon after surgery, I was informed that of the 8 lymph nodes they collected during surgery, 1 came back positive for papillary thyroid cancer.

Hi guys, ive been a lurker on this subreddit for quite awhile now but only now did I just kinda decide to ask some questions. I suffer from hand and feet hyperhidrosis on a daily basis, but compared to some that ive seen on this sub, mine is really relatively minor (slight layer of sweat on my hands and feet). However, it still affects me mentally and ive gotten some comments here and there from people. 

Im more or less convinced that it is a mental thing (anxious). This is so as firstly - My country is summer all year round (about 86 degrees F on average), secondly, my hands and feet sweat only about 80% of the time, and there are times that my hands and feet are completely dry (when im alone in bed, or when its raining). And lastly, my hands & feet sweat the most when Im in an air conditioned environment. And of course the standard, I know the handshake is coming and my hand just starts to sweat. + thinking about it just makes me sweat slightly more from my body. 

I was thinking of doing the home-made iontophoresis machine, but I do have some questions and probably need some assurance of what Im getting myself into. 
1) There are some results of the treatment causing people to sweat even more originally. Im afraid that if i start doing it, it will make my 20% dryness go away and my hand might just get worse. 
2) How long does the treatment normally take to take effect, and correct me if im wrong, but it only works on certain few. 
3) Which is the best article for a homemade machine?

Hello all!

I also posted this in r/thyroidhealth but figured you all might have some experiences too that you might be willing to share.

I may be jumping the gun a little here but I had a question and didnt know where else to ask.

Im having a FNA done on a couple of suspicious nodules that are on my right thyroid lobe on April 8th. Doc says if they come back as malignant or suspicious for malignancy well talk about surgery.

Over the last few years Ive been taking my health a lot more seriously and that has included eating right and losing weight. Ive made some pretty good gains in those areas and Id like to continue making them (still have 10 lbs. to go for my goal weight).

My question is, if they have to do surgery and remove my thyroid am I guaranteed to gain that weight back?

DISCLAIMER: Only my and a few other's experience. I can't guarantee that Vagantin Riemser works for you. I am not liable for your health and your actions.

I'm gonna make it short. I am from Germany, don't know if Vagantin Riemser pills are available where you live, but maybe similiar products. Vagantin Riemser are red-colored pills which contain 50 mg of Methanthelinium bromid each. It helped curing my hyperhidrosis by about 90%. They even had a small positive effect on my hyperhidrosis on days that I don't even take them. 
In Germany you need a prescription from your doctor to get them, i got a prescription for them from my skin doctor. 
My skin doctor told me to take them everyday for 2 weeks, as your body needs 2 weeks to make them work. After that you take them every day that you want the sweat barrier effect, which is almost every day for me. Every time you take one, it takes 2 hours until they stop your sweating for 5 (that's my experience) or 6 (that's what the company claims) hours. 
So I take them at 07:00 am when i wake up and later when I know that I'll need them two hours later. My skin doctor said that it's safe to take up to three of them per day. I now take them for 6 months and they have worked like a charm. Only downside I noticed is that the inner of my nose gets a little dry when I take them.
I have also read other reviews about Vagantin Riemser, some people had the same nose issue, some reported of slightly worse eyesight. But every review I read said that the pros outweighed the cons.
Regardless of the experiences I got and read of, I strictly advise everyone to do your best research on the risks of this and any other medicine you plan on taking. I also don't guarantee that Vagantin Riemser isn't interfering with any other medicine that you might take. I AM NO DOCTOR.

CONCLUSION:
In Germany, there is a red-colored pill that's called Vagantin Riemser. Each contains 50 mg of Methanthelinium bromid. In Germany, you need a doctor's prescription to buy it. Arguments for Vagantin Riemser are: For me and some other Germans it has worked. It also is legal in Germany which means it has gone through a process of testing by german medicine standards.
Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that it works for you. I also can't guarantee that it doesn't interfere with other medicine you might take nor can I assure that it doesn't expose you to a health risk without you consuming other medicine. 

Price in Germany is ~60 for 100 Pills, but there are also smaller packages on the german market.
60 converted to USD is around 70 USD.

DISCLAIMER: Only my and a few other's experience. I can't guarantee that Vagantin Riemser works for you. I am not liable for your health and your actions.

I'm gonna make it short. I am from Germany, don't know if Vagantin Riemser pills are available where you live, but maybe similiar products. Vagantin Riemser are red-colored pills which contain 50 mg of Methanthelinium bromid each. It helped curing my hyperhidrosis by about 90%. They even had a small positive effect on my hyperhidrosis on days that I don't even take them. 
In Germany you need a prescription from your doctor to get them, i got a prescription for them from my skin doctor. 
My skin doctor told me to take them everyday for 2 weeks, as your body needs 2 weeks to make them work. After that you take them every day that you want the sweat barrier effect, which is almost every day for me. Every time you take one, it takes 2 hours until they stop your sweating for 5 (that's my experience) or 6 (that's what the company claims) hours. 
So I take them at 07:00 am when i wake up and later when I know that I'll need them two hours later. My skin doctor said that it's safe to take up to three of them per day. I now take them for 6 months and they have worked like a charm. Only downside I noticed is that the inner of my nose gets a little dry when I take them.
I have also read other reviews about Vagantin Riemser, some people had the same nose issue, some reported of slightly worse eyesight. But every review I read said that the pros outweighed the cons.
Regardless of the experiences I got and read of, I strictly advise everyone to do your best research on the risks of this and any other medicine you plan on taking. I also don't guarantee that Vagantin Riemser isn't interfering with any other medicine that you might take. I AM NO DOCTOR.

CONCLUSION:
In Germany, there is a red-colored pill that's called Vagantin Riemser. Each contains 50 mg of Methanthelinium bromid. In Germany, you need a doctor's prescription to buy it.

Hi all!

I just got off the phone with my doc and she's not happy with my TSH levels. I don't get copies of the lab results but I think she said I'm at 0.2 and I should be between 0.0 and 0.05 (or something like that). She was given instructions by my endo to keep me highly suppressed as I am considered high risk (for context I have diffuse sclerosing variant so it spreads really really fast in the lymph nodes, I had 50 lymph nodes removed in my neck dissection and 30 were cancerous).

Right now I'm on 175 and she is bumping me up to 200 to try to get my TSH down. She's not sure if that's too high yet but we'll have to wait till my next bloodwork to find out.

Wondering, does anyone know what to look out for in terms of symptoms? Unlike most who start this journey with Hashimoto's, I actually started with Grave's so I've had an overactive thyroid and I remember having jitters, anxiety and heart palpitations. That was 10 years ago though so I'm just wondering if anyone has had other symptoms they can share?

I actually think I'm already experiencing the jitters and anxiety on the 175 dosage so I'm quite nervous to be bumped up. But it is necessary to prevent recurrence so I'm just gonna keep truckin.

Edit: also I did try googling this question but pretty much every site assumes being on too high a dosage is an accident lol, so not that helpful for my situation!"

Hello everyone! I came to the realization that i might have an issue wether it be ADHD or anything else when a friend of mine gave me adderall to be used for school. Ive always had issues focusing on school task or normal house chores and im easily distracted. The only reasons Ive come close to graduating is because a majority of my school has been online and that gives me the chance to listen to lectures and read on my own time and even then I tend to get distracted after 5 or 7 minutes of doing an assigned task. After taking adderall and comparing the results with my friends I feel as if I might have ADHD. Once I take Adderall, I get an overwhelming feeling of emotions and want to talk to everyone wether it be in person or online, as opposed to when i don't take adderall and tend to be more reserved. As opposed to my friends that feel it makes them focus more, I feel as if I still have trouble focusing or staying on topic but not to the extent of when I am not taking adderall.  Another issue is that when my friends take adderall they have restless nights and can easily stay ip where as in around 5 or 6 hours I tend to feel tired or crash. Im not sure if it's just that I have a lack of discipline, or something else but does anybody that is diagnosed with ADHD and has taken adderall feel the same? I plan on scheduling a doctors appointment soon and discussing other issues that I feel may be ADHD related in my life that I do not want to mention here, but I am unsure if I should bring up the adderall issue to my doctor for fear that my doctor might not take me serious and see me as a college kid trying to score some adderall or any type of drug that is similar."

Hello.

My girlfriend has been diagnosed with papillary carcinoma at the age of 24 with a metastasis status that has traveled to 2/7ths of her lymph nodes. She has had a hemithyroidectomy a couple of months ago. She recently went in for a checkup and a few noncancerous nodules were found. A complete thyroidectomy has been recommended, however, she is reluctant on getting it as she is worried it will affect her quality of life.

Her mom is pushing her to get the complete thyroidectomy just like almost any other mom would. She wants her daughter live cancer free as a complete thyroidectomy reduces the chances of the cancer coming back. I do believe, however, that her mom is acting purely on her emotions and not relying on any kind of logical information, aside that provided from her primary care provider surgeon. She is pushing her to get the complete thyroidectomy as soon as possible. While I understand her reasoning, I feel like my girlfriend should visit other professionals and get advice from them before making that final decision.

I am just trying to help as much as I can. I have been reading research papers and scouring forums to find any kind of information that may help my girlfriend make a sound decision. In no way, shape, or form am I trying to influence her choice. 

If anyone here has had a hemithyroidectomy and/or a complete thyroidectomy, may you please explain your experience with these procedures and post-op experience and quality of life? If you can give a recommendation, I would be happy to hear this out as well.

Im about to try ketamine therapy next weekend for issues completely unrelated to hyperhidrosis. The more I read about the therapy and its effects the more I wonder if it would be effective with hyperhidrosis due its impact on anxiety and other psychological ailments that can factor into HH. I dont know anyone who has HH and has also tried this therapy.  I also couldnt find information online.  

Have any of you with HH also tried ketamine therapy for unrelated reasons? Did you find a difference in your HH after? Better/worse? 

As far as I am aware this is not the intended use for the treatment but it seems to me that if certain psychological HH triggers are mitigated then it could potentially improve the HH. 

Thoughts?

UPDATE:
I have done 3 of 6 ketamine treatments over the last week.  I have lots of positive things to say! Specifically for HH I didnt notice a difference until after this 3rd treatment. My sweating is largely gone at this time. I think its directly related to my mental state and I sense it will return at some point. I cant do my other 3 treatments until a week from now so I might have more to say on the matter but right now holy smokes guys!"

Hi, I'm having surgery in two weeks, a hemithyroidectomy (I'm in the UK, I think it's the same as a lobectomy, basically just getting the half with the nodule out).


The biopsy was inconclusive so I feel like a bit of a fraud even posting here but I was hoping that I could ask a few questions because my anxiety is going crazy.

- How much pain were you in after surgery?
- How long did it take to be able to be independent in everything again?
- Did they give you anything to help with pain once you're home?
- How hard was it to fall asleep whilst recovering? Did you still share your bed with your partner?
- I've seen people say it's best to wear button-ups because it can be uncomfortable to stretch but can anyone say whether they had trouble putting a bra on? (Braless isn't really an option)
- If your biopsy was also inconclusive, how long did it take to find out if you had cancer or not after your surgery?

I think I'm going to change my radiation oncologist. I've never had a problem with doctors, but he seemed very rude, short, and after I told him I'm unsure of taking RAI, he told me he wouldn't answer any questions and to go back to the endo for questions. I don't have an appointment with them for 4 weeks. 

So I have a lot of questions. 

How did you come out of RAI? I've seen a lot of threads about regretting it. 

I'm nervous about fertility, I'm especially nervous about weight gain. I'd almost rather not do it at all if it will make me gain a significant amount of weight. 

I was at 125 last year, and gone up to 140 in the past year. I got diagnosed with thyroid cancer and had stage 4 papillary and got a total thyroidectomy in early November. I've been very concerned with how this has/will affect my weight and I'm already scared I won't be able to lose what I've gained. 

I've also read maintaining synthroid will make you lose what you've gained within a few months

How long are you off synthroid due to RAI? If it's 2-4 weeks, how does that affect your weight and do you lose it when you ""resume""? I was given a whole booklet on weight and nutrition for taking the RAI- this is an incredibly triggering topic for me, so I would really like to know how people were affected by their weight following the pill. 

Other concerns, is I don't know how much of a dosage I'll receive, and what difference that makes. I also read about it affecting your teeth, and my teeth are already fragile and I have braces. Will it cause my teeth to break,crack, etc due to having braces? 

I've also been experiencing fatigue (sleeping 15 hours when possible), so I'm also concerned my synthroid isn't even correct as it is. It's just feeling very overwhelming. 

He told me I was in an ""immediately risk"" zone, and not that I don't belive him but I would like to hear from my thyroid Dr or oncologist to see if they think it's a necessary procedure. Im afraid I have no choice to go through with RAI, considering the stage 4 diagnoses despite TT. and scared of being at high risk of it returning (which I'm also confused about, if I've already had the TT  where would it return?)

I can't get blood tests to check my levels and get an x ray to check to see if I gave any left over tissue in my body for 4 weeks. If anyone has any personal experience or advice, I really need help getting through this."

Surgery or watch and wait for small persistent disease?!
Hello everyone :)

I (33F) have PTC tall cell variant. I had a TT in June of 2020, they also took 8 lymph nodes in the central neck and 4 were positive. Had RAI (100 mci) in Septembre 2020. During the whole body scan after RAI, I had uptake in the right thyroid bed. My Tg was 4 before RAI and gradually dropped to 0.2 in the following year.

At all my last US (March 2021, June 2021 and December 2021), the radiologist noted that I had a persistent nodule in the right thyroid bed. Between June and December, it grew from 6 mm to 10 mm so my surgeon decided to biopsy and sure enough, it came back positive for cancer.

Now my surgeon intends to give me the choice between another round of RAI (which I absolutely don't want, my salivary glands are already messed up), surgery OR active surveillance. He told me to think about it and we will meet for an appointment in three weeks and decide together.

He says that revision surgery would be 5 times more risky for my vocal chords and my parathyroids (than the initial surgery). He also says that the nodule is in a location where it is not likely to metastasize. But at the same time he says the pathology of my initial tumors was agressive (tall cell variant, hobnail features and BRAF mutation). I think he's hesitating too!

On the one hand, my Tg is very very low (it increased with the nodule size but only from 0.2 to 0.4). But the nodule is growing. Is it growing fast? 4 mm  increase in 6 months is considered slow or fast growth?

I don't know what to do!!! I'm looking for stories here. Did something similar happen to you? What did you do? What did your surgeon recommend? Were you given options? What would you do in my place?"

Anyway, can I use 2 packets for 240ml for either of the regular or xylotol rinse? Can I do one of each? How often do I do the xylotol? I was intending to alternate, is that OK? 
Also what is the significance that I can breath out of my nose but feel congested behind it with pain in my forehead. The pain eases if I can get my nose to run like after some spicy foods. Was told I had a deviated septum years ago but insurance has denied a CT scan so I dropped the issue and made do with psuedephedrine and excedein migraine."

I got diagnosed with GP when I was maybe around 12, Im now 25. At the time, the specialists/doctors I went to didnt feel comfortable or inclined (for whatever reason), to give me any GP specific medication to treat it.

Ive just suffered with all the other symptoms and cycled between starving myself and then over eating because obviously not eating isnt sustainable long term.

Fast forward to now- I learn something new about gastroparesis CONSTANTLY & have finally reached a point where I will be returning to a specialist in the new year to get medication & see where my GP currently stands. Today, I learned that PPIs can not only cause liver and kidney damage/failure, but also, that when taken long term, they can delay gastric emptying & digestion by 15-40%

Im absolutely horrified. I just took what the doctors/adults in my life told me to do when I first got diagnosed and ran with it- aka the use of PPIs. 

I obviously now need to get off the PPIs, but Im pretty confident that my body is fully dependent on the use of them now & I am going to be in even more pain weaning off of them. 

Has anyone gone through this before? Why is communication/knowledge about gastroparesis so poor- Ive had this diagnosis for over a decade, told many doctors about my use of nexium, and read hundreds of studies and articles about it.

-

Has anyone else experienced this? 

I am a 37/f, 130lbs, healthy, follow the paleo diet for the last 6 months. Rather sedentary but in good shape. Ive never had high blood sugar issues. My dad had diabetes in his 50s but controlled it with his diet (I dont know much more than that). 

I had Covid the first week of December 2021. I was not vaccinated. I had body aches, headaches, lost my sense of smell.

I felt better after about 3 weeks. Then I started feeling bad again. Very tired, very thirsty, dizzy, just out of it. I kept thinking it was just lingering effects of Covid, but it was getting worse. One day I was feeling shaky and lightheaded, but I had just eaten a good protein rich meal. I decided I would take my blood sugar, and it was 374. Thought for sure my meter was broken, took it again an hour later and it was 389. Did some Googling and found some articles about Covid related diabetes. 

I called the nurses line to see if I should go to the ER, and she said while it wasnt life threatening, I needed to make an appt with my dr for first thing in the morning. I fasted because I knew theyd do bloodwork. BS at the dr was 293. High ketones in my urine. Said it definitely looks like I have diabetes but she thought it was very odd for it so come on so suddenly, especially based on my age/weight/health. I told her about my articles I read where covid attacks the pancreas and makes it harder for it to do its job (forgive my ignorance). She had never heard of this but said shed do some research. 

Prescribed me metformin, 500 mg twice a day for 2 weeks, then up from there. Started first pill last night after dinner, took the second this morning after breakfast. Havent got my labs back yet. Dr said to take my BS each morning after fasting, dont worry about doing it after meals. Said if I have confusion, vomiting, severe nausea, to go to the ER. 

I ate healthy again today, very low carbs, at lunch a snack that had sugar, but nothing crazy. But I dont feel good tonight again, just feel really drained and kind of shaky and off. Took my BS and it was 463. I ate about 2-3 hours ago. This sounds so high and scary! But Im not disoriented, Im not nauseas or vomiting. So I assume Im okay to just deal with it? I read that metformin can take 4-5 days to really even start working. I cant imagine having my BS this high for days is good? Idk, I dont know much about any of this so I guess I just want to hear from the experience of others. TIA!"

I feel like absolute dog crap! My throat is swollen and black and blue, my voice is gone and I keep having to hack up mucus from the ET tube which hurts like hell. They told me this surgery wasnt painfulthey lied! 

Anyone else have a ton of trouble swallowing after surgery? I have to force myself to eat. I know all recoveries are individual but I wasnt expecting this level of discomfort. I was told no Advil or other anti inflammatory medication due to bleeding risk and every time I walk into the kitchen I see the bottle of Toradol my GP prescribed and I want to take one because I know it will help but I dont want to make it worse. I have some other medication but I think the Toradol would work better! 

To add insult to injury I think my vocal cords are really swollen because when I breathe it sounds like rumbling mucus but nothing more is coming up when I cough. Instead there is a weird feeling in my throat like somethings moving. IDK, trying to get some more sleep and not think too much about whether I have thyroid cancer. 

I wish theyd taken the whole thyroid because after feeling like this, I wont be happy if I need a completion procedure! Not sure I can do this twice!

I haven't been diagnosed, (waiting for my appointment) but everything I experience seems to match with grade 1 gastroparesis.

I get these symptoms maybe once a week? Mainly in the morning if I'm anxious.

However, these symptoms I described most recently came up after weaning off of sertraline (Zoloft). I read that SSRIs can cause gastroparesis, so I wanted to know if anyone here's experienced that. But I also have loads of family history that includes digestion problems, so this may not be Zoloft related.

Also, while I was taking sertraline I was taking famotodine, so if anyone has experience with that, I'd love some details.

Hi all,

Im really hoping someone can help, Im at the end of my rope. Ive had severe back and neck pain going on 5 years now and I cant seem to get anyone to figure out what it is. Im seriously starting to think its in my head but the amount of pain Im in, it has to be something. Im going to try give as much detail as possible and will bullet point information under headings to be more concise. Please let me know if you need more information. 

Demographics:
* 30 Female
* Height: 5 8
* Weight: 170
* Medications: Advil, birth control (Marvelon), THC
* Non-smoker

Childhood:
* Avid sports player (basketball, volleyball, rugby) until high school
* Played recreationally until I was 23 
* Sprained both ankles in a tournament and stopped being as active

Background:
* Pain started in my lower back when I was about 25. 
* Pain radiates to upper back and neck. Lower back is no longer as severe. 
* Upper back and neck usually start mid-day and by night time Im usually at a 9-10. 
* Pain also radiates to my fingers. 
* Cracking neck and fingers can sometimes relieve the pressure and provide relief for a little bit. 

Medical:
* Family doctor told me initially that it would go away on its own and didnt really believe me. I felt like I was crazy and didnt go back. After four years of being in constant pain, I went back and he sent me for some blood work. 
* Blood work showed inflammation and he suggested sending me to a rheumatologist. 
* Saw a Rheumatologist and they were certain it was Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) as my life story fit. 
* I was hesitant to start biologics and paid for an MRI. 
* MRI showed no inflammation in lower back
* Rheumatologist then agreed to send me for a neck MRI, back x-ray. 
* They all came back clean. No fusing. No major inflammation. 
* Rheumatologist no longer beloved its AS and have sort of sent me back to my family doctor. 

The Rheumatologist noted, not all medical terminology of course, my interpreted notes:

	Minor degenerative changes
	Little of the narrowing of the pointy part by the hunchback
	No inflammatory changes seen
	Moderate disc disease
	No protruding of disc

She stated that she is assured it is not a spondylitis. And although a small subset of people that have non-radial spondylitis that would not show in X-ray but would show in mri generally, but with these people medications would not work.

Medications:
* 12 hour extra strength Advil sometimes works as does Advil muscle. 
* Two NSAIDs rheumatologist prescribed had no effect. 
* THC every night to sleep otherwise the pain wont let me. 

Other:
* Im constantly at a 9-10 from the pain in my neck and upper back at night. 
* During the day its sometimes at 5-7. 

The pain is impacting my life and mood and I just hope someone has some idea of whats happening. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my story."

tldr; if you're concerned about/can't tolerate dyes or fillers, try euthyrox

I've tried about 4 different T4 brands by now. One was synthroid, which worked well but some of the dyes did not agree with me and led to me discovering new allergies. Since I've had to change my dosage, that was also problematic since they use different dyes for each one.

Another I didn't catch the name, but I think it was Pfizer's generic, but I could clearly feel that it wasn't as strong as the Synthroid, so that wouldn't work.

I tried switching to Tirosint briefly, hoping for the best since there were no fillers involved, but after about 7 days I noticed that my dosage was too low, and by 10 days I'd spiraled into a hypothyroid depression. When I looked on [drugs.com](https://drugs.com), I noticed a lot of reviewers having the same issue with it ever since a change of manufacturer/distributor. And yet no recall.

Can anyone relate?
Hi,
I have recently joined reddit for another issue unrelated to what I will post about here. My boyfriend and his mom for the past five years have been caregivinging for my boyfriend's 29 y.o. brother. 

My boyfriend's brother has an unusual form of epilepsy. He has multiple seizures a day, and has had them every day starting 5 years ago. He has, as I understand it, hypermotor seizures, and does not have the tonic clonic seizures. So when he has individual seizures, he doesn't need to go the the ER, but the seizures involve a lot of arm and leg movement, and he can injure himself, or potentially injure others, quite seriously. 

My boyfriend's brother has had epilepsy since he was a baby. His epilepsy has always been intractable, but before the increase in his seizures five years ago he would generally have nighttime seizures that didn't impact his daily life. I don't know a lot about his medication, but I know he is on quite high amounts of anti-seizure medication. I know that the college of pharmacists in our area issues him a letter every so often, because he is on a very high doses of anti-seizure medication. As I think people know here in this subreddit, the anti-seizure medication has lots of side effects that affect daily life. My boyfriend's brother is also trying professionally prescribed CBD treatments, but he finds this frustrating because the cbd is not covered by our government Healthcare plans and he pays a high amount for CBD oil and doesn't feel like it's making much of a difference. 

He also had a neuro surgery to help, but after a few months the seizures became just as frequent as they were before the surgery. I believe it was confirmed my boyfriend's brother has ""focal cortical displasia."" My understanding is that neurologists were able to confirm this after examining brain tissue after the surgery.

His form of epilepsy has affected his daily life quite a bit. My boyfriend's whole family would like him to live at home. Another problem is the uncertainty of the situation.  My boyfriend's brother and the whole family hopes the situation will improve, but there is no knowledge about what can be expected. I think the other option is to put their 29 year old family member in long term care, which the family is very uncertain about and saddened about putting a loved one, as a young man, into a long term care facility. They do not want to pursue this option. I don't know if anyone here has had this challenge: whether to put a loved one (or personally deciding) about going into a long term care facility, or trying to live at home.

Is there anyone else here who has experience, personally or another loved one, with intractable epilepsy, focal cortical displasia, or with hypermotor seizures? 

I think it is a more rare form of epilepsy, and I don't believe a lot of people in the city where we live has very many people, if there is anyone at all, who have the same condition as my boyfriend's brother. I would like to learn more. 

I don't live with my boyfriend's brother. At the moment the mom, and the two brothers are all living together to support one another. As I date my boyfriend over time, I am here with the family during weekends, over holidays and such. Although my boyfriend's brother is an adult, and I don't live with the family, i am not really involved in his care, I'm just more of a witness to what's going on with the family, and am interested to learn more.

1.can our turbinate swell without syptoms? No blockage,no runny nose,no pains anywhere. (I do not know how long it has been like that)
2.is it possible that the swelling only happen on one nostril only?
3. Could it be that the reason for my decreased sense of smell was bcoz of my swollen turbinate?

Looking for advice, comfort, other's stories...
I (26F) had suffered with severe heartburn for years, but Tums, Pepto and a glass of milk seemed to help. In January 2021, I had severe, sharp, crushing chest pain that radiated to my teeth and back and I thought I was having a heart attack. I went to the ER and they did all the cardiac blood tests,  an EKG, and a D-Dimer to look for clots. Everything checked out normal and they sent me home, only for it to happen over and over. Sometimes I would get one every day, and sometimes I wouldn't get one for weeks. I suffered with those pains all through the summer, until I finally reached out to my PCP in November. After some discussion she diagnosed me with GERD, and told me my chest pains were esophageal spasms. She had me take Zantac-360 for six weeks, which helped with the heartburn but overall didn't stop the spasms.

Last Saturday (1/1/22) I began having severe stomach pains along with a spasm. It felt like a hot fist just clenching in my stomach over and over. I had some chest heaviness with it, and my anxiety was through the roof. I dealt with it for a few  days and finally went in yesterday to get it checked out, with a new doctor. She did labs on me (all normal), and prescribed me Protonix for six weeks to see if that would ultimately stop my spasms, stomach pain and heartburn. I've done some research on Protonix and noticed some people have severe side effects - some people have mild - and some have none at all. I took my first pill last night and I'm feeling a little anxious as to what might happen. I worry about heart palpitations and seizures, as my family has a history of heart issues.

How many of you have been on Protonix? What were your experiences? Are there short-term side effects or do the most serious side effects only occur if you are on it long-term?

Also, if anyone has any input on esophageal spasms or the chest pains associated with GERD, I'd love to hear any advice/stories on that too. This has been the scariest part for me. I've spent nights wide awake praying for my heartburn to come back full force instead of having to feel another spasm. It's gotten to the point where sometimes I'm scared to go to sleep because I wonder ""what if it isn't a spasm this time?""

Any advice, words of wisdom, comfort, tips and tricks...anything will help at this point. Sorry if this is alot, I appreciate anyone who read this!!"
t5_2rhwk,rzt0rv,"Read today on Reddit that the more water in the tray, the more the resistance to the electrical current.","[{""crowd-entity-annotation"":{""entities"":[]}}]","My first 3 weeks with iontophoresis
Day 1
12/23/21 Received my Dermadry via FedEx. Pretty excited to try it out. If this works it will literally change my life. Cant imagine life without hyperhydrosis, its going to be amazing. I placed the order on the 19th so Im really amazed its here already, especially with all the holiday rush. 

Setup was easy and quicker than I anticipated. The manual said to start on a lower setting and work my way up. Thats definitely not my style. Applied the max setting on the hands, feet, and underarms.  It really wasnt that bad, I wouldnt even say it made it to the uncomfortable range. Just some tingling except for a few pulses throughout the treatment. My hands itched for a few minutes right after and seems to sweat a bit more than usual. The feet treatment was a breeze, could hardly tell it was on and I had my hands free to check emails. The underarms were the most noticeable that something was happening. A slight burning sensation but not too bad. My underarms were red for about an hour where the pads were. 

Before I went to bed I noticed my hands and feet were moist but not dripping like normal. They felt slightly different. Could this mean its working already?  The manual says it could take weeks to see results. Time will tell. 

Day 2 
Setup was even quicker since I already knew what to do. I added 17 oz to each tray to get better coverage. Yesterday I only did about 8 oz each. With more water it seemed to pulse less intensely. Not sure if its supposed to send out a pulse of electricity every now and then but it does  its still not bad, even on the max setting. Otherwise similar experience to yesterday.  

If it would allow, I would have definitely upped the intensity even more. 

It takes me about an hour to do the hands, feet, and underarms. Thats a lot of time per week to devote to these treatments. It really shows how annoying severe hyperhydrosis can be that someone would be willing to go to such great lengths to even see a reduction in sweating. 

After my treatment today, I played video games with the kids. My hands sweated a lot but not more than normal. I guess it was about average. After the games, they stopped sweating as much for a bit but then sweated more than normal the rest of the day. 

Day 3
Woke up all dry, which is normal but I tend to start sweating before I even get out the bed. Today I was dry all morning!  Almost didnt want to start my treatment so I could just enjoy being dry but Im doing my 3rd treatment now. 

After the treatment I sweated more than normal. Pretty much dripping all day until bedtime. 

Day 4
Woke up dry but within 20 minutes I was dripping sweat more than normal. Did my 4th treatment and then sweated all day again more than normal but probably a bit less than yesterday.  Hoping the increased sweat will start to taper down from here, its starting to really get on my nerves. Read a few articles that said after 5 treatments the increased sweating tapered down. Hopefully tomorrow I will see the same. 

I kept reading about people using SP water because of the high TDS. I measured mine and its 165. 

Day 5
Woke up with very dry hands, feet, and underarms. It actually felt kinda weird. When I looked at my hands they looked shiny.  Not sure what that was about. dried sweat maybe but the shiny went away after I washed them. They stayed dry until I got to work and then my sweat glads turned on like a faucet for about 2 hours. After that my hands, feet, and underarms went to moist. Not sure if all this is normal for day 5, but I can feel something changing, so Im excited to see whats going to happen. Change is good. 

My underarms feel a bit tender today. Might end up having to bump it down a bit from the max setting of 8 depending on how irritated the skin gets. 

Read today on Reddit that the more water in the tray, the more the resistance to the electrical current. Makes sense because I noticed less intensity with 17oz in each tray as compared to 8.5oz. Ill try 12oz of water today. 

Treatment 5 went good. Definitely more intense with 12 oz. My hands tingled more and my feet felt like they were burning. Might try 10 or 11oz next time. Tomorrow is a day off of the treatment as recommended by Dermadry. They say 5 treatments a week max, and today is 5 in a row. Ill be doing Mon, Wed, Friday, Sat, Sun and today is Monday. 

Still sweating more than pre iontophoresis. 

Day 6
12/28/21 No treatment day! I really want to do the treatment but Im trying to do everything by the book as best I can. 

Woke up dry as a bone and was dry until about 3:00pm. From there it went to clammy.

Day 7
Woke up dry again. Remained dry until I did my treatment around noon. Seems like the treatment woke up my sweat glands. Sweated all day after the treatment 

I used 10oz of water this time. I think 11 or 12 is best. 10 didnt seem like enough. 

Day 8
No treatment. Was dry all day including going to Jiu Jitsu. Sweated during training and then it stopped after. Amazing. 

Day 9
Dry about 3/4 of the day. Started sweating at about 3:00pm and then dried up about 8:00pm   Started sweating again after my treatment for a couple hours but was dry before I went to sleep. 

Day 10
Dry until I did my treatment at noon. Sweated about a half hour after then dried up again. Played video games in the afternoon which made me sweat until I went to bed. 

Day 11 
Treatment number 9. Dry until noon and then a bit clammy off and on. 
After my treatment, sweated for less than an hour and then was dry all day. 

Day 12    1-3-22
Was completely dry all day. My hands were actually so dry that the skin started cracking. I put some chapstick on the areas that were cracking because thats all I had and that seemed to do the trick. It was actually a really cold day and felt amazing to be dry and cold. So much better than wet and cold. The air was pretty dry today so it left me wondering if I would have been that dry if it were really humid outside. 
Treatment 10 is supposed to be the one where the extra sweating from iontophoresis is gone and it was. I did my treatment before bed after having been dry all day. The skin on my hands was cracked from dryness and it made the treatment very painful. Definitely will need to apply Vaseline on the cracked skin next time. After the treatment I remained dry. 

Day 13
Woke up extremely dry. Hands were cracking and skin was broken and bleeding. Ive never had to put lotion on my hands before and the few times I did in the past it triggered and instant flood of sweat. I think Ive applied it 10 times today and my hands are still dry!  Its truly amazing and a wonderful problem that I more than welcome. Ill probably have to put Vaseline on some sores tomorrow before treatment. 

Day 14 - 2weeks 1-5-22
Dry all day again. Had to apply lotion 5 or 6 times. Ordered some OKeeffes Working Hands hand cream.  Its supposed to be some pretty good stuff. My goal is to stay dry but not have the skin on my hands crack.  If I can do that with one application of a good hand cream each night, that would be ideal. 
I put Vaseline on my sores and it protected them well during treatment. 

Day 15 - 1-6-22
Its so nice being truly dry. I was so much more comfortable at work today without being all wet the whole time. I was actually dry at Jiu Jitsu today until I started rolling.  Its amazing.  Im able to hold my wifes hand without making a sweat puddle, put my hand under my pillow at night without completely soaking it, and shake hands at work without having to explain why my hands are dripping with sweat. 

Day 17 1-8-22
Had phantom sweating today while I was playing video games. Felt like I was dripping wet with sweat and kept wiping my hands on my pants but they were dry. Its the strangest feeling ever. 
Got my hand cream in. Hopefully it works better than the cheap lotion I have to apply 5 to 10 times a day. 

Day 18
The hand cream worked very well last night. Woke up with smooth dry hands. I got a tube of the OKeefes night time cream which I applied before bed and used the regular OKeefes this morning. 

At this point Im counting iontophoresis as a success. Ive been dry for a week now and it feels awesome. I really didnt think this level of dryness would ever be possible because my condition is so severe. 

Im going to stop doing daily updates and start making periodic notes when something changes. 

My current plan is to continue doing 5 days a week until I finish 6 weeks. Im hopeful that 3 days a week will be enough to maintain dryness during the maintenance phase."

* Nasalcrom

* Oxymetazoline HCL

* Trimcinolone Acetonide

* Fluticasone

* Xlear

* Saline

I had a bad experience with Fluticasone and got some pretty bad headaches after a week or two of usage. Nasalcrom has been pretty benign and I don't notice any effect. I'm currently trying Trimcinolone Acetonide as an alternative corticoid to see if that works better. I have used Xlear in the past with no noticeable results.

Should I be using any one in particular for my issue and should I use any of them in conjunction? I'm also considering following up with my doctor and getting an antihistamine spray?

Hello newbie here. I recently joined this subreddit as I think I might have GERD/LPR. I had been having reoccurring cold like symptoms since thanksgiving day.

Im planning on making an appointment with a specialist soon to confirm as I feel the doctor at the urgent care couldve been a much better help.

Whether it's the dry air (from the heating system during the winter) or some virus infection (we all get sick around this time of year, right?) there's no way I was going to go through that again.

So basically I used the gel I bought last year, so before I go to bed I would use a Q-Tip and put a tiny bit up each nostril. No nosebleeds so far.

Is this the experience for anyone else in Canada? I know things are backed up but it's kind of ridiculous to just keep pushing further when things already don't look good. I've been trying to get my health taken seriously since last may and they confirmed the nodule in November. Should I try to go somewhere else for surgery and treatment?

My husband has had a radio frequency ablation in the past that helped him greatly for almost a year and he's about to have another one done. He's taken both Naproxen and Celebrex, they don't really help the pain at all (marijuana does help though but we live in a fully illegal state). X-rays don't show anything, an MRI has shown facet joint arthritis/degenerative disc disease.


His rheumatologist offered Humira or another anti-TNF drug today to try and see if it helps his pain. He was given information on the drugs and the possible cancer is worrisome and the fact it suppresses the immune system doesn't sound good either. He just wants to be pain free but he's not sure if the risk is worth it, especially if it might not work.

Dear all I want to share with you something interesting about a potential treatment.  
I was searching something about the possible block of cutaneous type c amyelinated sudomotor fiber (big words to indicate the nerves which lead the stimuli to sweat glands). I came across this study from Harvard Medical School: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057686/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057686/)   
(Gibbons CH, Wang N, Freeman R. *Capsaicin induces degeneration of cutaneous autonomic nerve fibers*. Ann Neurol. 2010 Dec;68(6):888-98. doi: 10.1002/ana.22126. PMID: 21061393; PMCID: PMC3057686.)  
What does it state?  
Basically an occlusive application for 2 days of a **capsaicin** based cream at 0.1% of concentration led to a degeneration of autonomic cutaneous fiber, as **sudomotor fiber**, for a long period of 16 days before their slow regeneration, completed after more than 50 days
This is the rational behind my idea of using this kind of preparation to treat focal hyperhidrosis.

Dear all I want to share with you something interesting about a potential treatment.  
I was searching something about the possible block of cutaneous type c amyelinated sudomotor fiber (big words to indicate the nerves which lead the stimuli to sweat glands). I came across this study from Harvard Medical School: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057686/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3057686/)   
(Gibbons CH, Wang N, Freeman R. *Capsaicin induces degeneration of cutaneous autonomic nerve fibers*. Ann Neurol. 2010 Dec;68(6):888-98. doi: 10.1002/ana.22126. PMID: 21061393; PMCID: PMC3057686.)  
What does it state?  
Basically an occlusive application for 2 days of a **capsaicin** based cream at 0.1% of concentration led to a degeneration of autonomic cutaneous fiber, as **sudomotor fiber**, for a long period of 16 days before their slow regeneration, completed after more than 50 days
This is the rational behind my idea of using this kind of preparation to treat focal hyperhidrosis.   
I believe there are otc product based on capsaicin for treating pain and other topical condition linked to a nerves overactivity. It has widely been studied also for neuropathic pain in diabetes and autonomic condition.

HI All,

I had a bit of a scare and unusual RAI experience, and I haven't found any mention of something similar, so I'll share it here and maybe one of you has had this, or maybe it will help someone else in the future. On my second day of RAI, I lost my voice, and had a distinct nodule of pain/ swelling behind and beside my voicebox. I was sure it was left behind lymph nodes from the surgery, but I was also sure my Surgeon had taken all the lymph nodes from that area. I'm in in a country where we isolate in hospital for the first couple of days, so super scary and difficult.

At my scan, it turns out (unsurprsingly!) that the sensitive area had taken up a lot of the Iodine, and it looked like healthy thyroid tissue!

I learned that when the thryoid develops, it starts out under the tongue and migrates downward. Bits of tissue can be left along the way, and the specialist nurse in my ward said that usually people who lose their sense of taste during RAI often have remnant thyroid tissue under the tongue that can be seen on their scans. (I asked if they were planning to publish this data, but no plans at the moment!)  For me, the remnant tissue was in a highly unusual place, up next to my voice box, much higher than my actual thyroid was. It was pretty big- 2 cm by 1 cm which caused the swelling resulting in my voice loss. It also explained my weird post surgery thryoglobulin results- 6ish- much higher than my surgeon expected based on his usual results, but pretty low for any kind of distant mets. I think I expected a host of lymph nodes to light up and had a fear that's I'd be back in surgery for a more extensive neck dissection, so I'm happy with these results as unexpected as they are. I suspect my neck will be swollen for a little while as that's a lot of injured thyroid tissue that my body is going to need to clean out.

Anyway, just wondering if anyone else had had something like this, or if anyone has seen any scientific publications about ectopic thyroid tissue and RAI. I have seen a few where the thyroid didn't migrate at all, and the only reason it was discovered is that someone got thyroid cancer in their tongue! We are amazing, but sometimes it can go so wrong!"

A Google search on each one of these will pull up links to the studies. Just search for NIH, epilepsy, and the above medication, and most of them show up to half of the people in the control groups saw improvement, and placebo no change. I think one of the studies was on dogs, though. 
So if you're sick of epilepsy, then maybe throw everything you can at it, especially if it doesn't have to be prescribed. Although I read in the UK, some supplements must be prescribed, like melatonin."

TLDR: I had a severe reaction to my first Cimzia injection. Drs dont know why or what to do and I am terrified. I need any advice and hope you can give me.

- I was first diagnosed about 2 weeks ago, but felt hopeful to have a plan and was prescribed cimzia. I was told it was a very safe medication, so safe that its the best biologic recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding. I have a 5 month old so thats great news. 

Monday I got my first dose at 3:30 and felt great! I was excited to get treatment started. At 7:30, things started to change. I got very hot, nauseous, and my heart started racing. I tracked my heart rate on my Apple Watch and it was 170 resting!!! We were at a friends house so I told my husband it was time for us to go home. He looked at me shocked because my eyes were bloodshot. They felt fine though. I called the dr and was told to watch my symptoms and call back if anything changed. 2 minutes later, Im covered head to toe in hives. It started at my injection site and spread from there. My lips were tingling and my throat was getting tight. I took 2 Benadryl, called the dr back and went straight to the ER. They gave me steroids and Pepcid and it started to improve. I was given a prescription for more steroids and an epi pen. 

The next day, I felt better but had light hives on my legs still. I took 1 Benadryl and felt great the rest of the day. I even went to my workout class. 

But on Wednesday, today, I woke up and could not see. My eyes (not eyelids) were swollen and in pain. I could not open them at all. My husband had to walk me around and lead me through the dr office, make my calls, etc. I felt trapped in my mind. I went to the rheumatologist and he didnt know what to do. Said he had never had any patients with a reaction to Cimzia before. He sent me to the allergist and then an  opthalmologist. 

It was going to be several hours before they could see me, so I decided to go to the ER while waiting. They gave me the same drugs as Monday, but a few minutes after, I felt instantaneous relief. I had this weird bubbling and draining sensation in my eyes. I could hear it too. It sounded like a carbonated drink if you listen closely. Like the swelling was going down internally. After that, I was able to open them slightly. I was discharged and sent immediately to my next appointment. 

The ophthalmologist told me I definitely have uveitis but that I also had something else causing inflammation of my corneas. She said it was unlike anything she had seen from patients with AS related uveitis. She gave me steroid drops, numbing drops, and dilated my eyes. This helped tremendously but it is still hard to open my eyes. 

Im following up with her again Friday and my rheumatologist again tomorrow. I have no idea where to go from here. I even called my CIMplicity nurse and the FDA drug safety rep and they have never had anyone respond like this. My rheumatologist told me that if I am truly allergic to the cimzia, I am probably allergic to all other biologics. 

Has anyone ever had an allergic reaction like this? If so, were any other biologics an option for you? If you developed uveitis was it this severe? All Ive read about is red eyes and pain."

I've had them most of my life, but have taken measures to prevent them from reoccurring as frequently or as severely.  I had a deviated septum, and had it corrected 8-9 years back.  This was a key procedure that prevented infections for most of the time since I had it fixed.  I've also gone through immunotherapy with allergy shots - this was invaluable to keeping me from constant suffering, although I do have to supplement allergy meds from time to time - still a major improvement.

This year, though, has tested me in every way imaginable.  I've had multiple sinus infections, most of which I attribute to having a one-year-old in daycare.  She's my kryptonite.  Nailed me in August with a cold that went full infection and took a week of Augmentin to clear out.  November rolls around, and I hear a 'crunch' from my right sinus and the next five weeks turn to hell.  First two I suffer and monitor discharge color, which gets progressively worse.  I'm doing sinus rinses, but they're not really helping.  Get a round of Augmentin, doesn't really phase it.  Go to the ENT, confirms the infection being very active, two more weeks of Doxycyclin.  Incremental improvement and discharge improves a lot, but still congested almost 100%, and just on my right side.  This was tolerable because it really stayed there and didn't migrate left too.  Weird.

During that four weeks, I'm pissed, miserable, frustrated, and exhausted.  I start researching all of the different ways to clear this shit from my head.  Saving you all the details, I landed on a 2015 Baylor study and some readily available ingredients that are anti-microbial and anti-fungal.  I'm going all-in because I'm done dealing with this.

First aspect - baby shampoo in my sinus rinse.  Nothing new here, but this was the Baylor study and equates to what we learned about hand-washing with Covid.  You need to penetrate the biofilm layer so your immune system and antibiotics can get to the bacteria and viruses or the soap can kill it.  I started with Johnson's baby shampoo but realized I may have sensitivity to the fragrance they add, as even babies need fragrance free shit with sensitive skin.  I bought some Aquafor (fragrance free) and start using towards the end of antibiotics.  Also found Grapefruit Seed Extract and learned about Xylitol - both are used heavily in these subs, and they should be.

I continued the baby shampoo rinse three times per day...at one point, before antibiotics, I was doing it every two hours but didn't really feel the difference and my nose was suffering a bit (also before Aquafor), so I backed off.  The other critical aspect was minimizing the congestion so I could get medication where it needed to go and hit the key parts of the sinuses that weren't being reached.  I used some generic Afrin and Privine - Afrin ONLY AT NIGHT though.  If you use it during the day plus night, you'll be limited to three days max usage (rebound effects). If you only use it at night, which is when you need it most (to breath better and actually sleep), you can extend to four or five nights, because the med isn't in your system constantly and you shouldn't rebound.

During this time, I also learned about and found Xlear, both sinus rinse and nasal spray - nasal spray is a GAME CHANGER.  The nasal spray is a sinus rinse in spray form and allows you to inhale those key ingredients (Xylitol and GSE) exactly where they need to go.  This improved my symptoms dramatically.  Here's the routine:

Night - use the Afrin, give it 10 - 20 mins to fully clear the congestion so you can breath through both nostrils.

Next:  sinus rinse with Xlear and baby shampoo/wash.  I used a one to one-and-a-half packets of Xlear rinse formula with a full tsp of baby shampoo in 8 oz of boiled water.  I started with a 1/2 tsp and that wasn't enough to make a difference for me.  I focused more on my right side - I'd rinse, then trap some water in by holding my nose and moving it around my sinuses.  It burned a bit, which translated to things working and the soap doing what it was supposed to.  It didn't burn on my left side so I knew I was hitting the inflamed/infected areas.  After the rinse, I'd let my sinuses settle for another 15 - 30 mins.  Then I hit them with the Xlear nasal spray, 2 - 4 sprays in each nostril, inhaling deeply and focusing air movement both up and back so I'd hit the key points of infection.

I did this for a solid week - stopped the afrin after 4-5 nights as I was improving...and noticed steady improvement within a few days and over the next 7.  While I did have some lingering colored discharge, it went almost all clear/white within a week.  I'm now breathing almost 100% through both sides of my nose.

Morning routine was similar - my congestion was still clear from the previous night's Afrin, so rinse again first thing, wait 15 - 30 mins, then hit the nasal spray again.

**I used the nasal spray every two hours each day for a week** \- the ingredients are all natural so there's no rebound or dependency, just anti-virus and anti-bacterial elements constantly fighting for you in your sinuses.  I honestly believe this is what led to the fastest recovery - getting those elements directly into the sinuses where they could work best.  Rinses are great for clearing things out, but being able to inhale those ingredients directly was crucial.

There's nothing really 'new' here, but I did a shitload of trial and error and finally found things that help - the key is using them in an order that will benefit the most.  Nasal sprays used while congested are literally wasting money, and sinus rinses that don't have ingredients that can't really attack an infection aren't doing much for you either.  My follow-up with the ENT was before I started these products and routine, and they reco'd sinus surgery to fix my issues.  I won't be doing that.

Hope this helps...one man's mission for better quality of life."

On thursday, I had my second Tonic Clonic seizure in less than two months. I'm T1D and my blood sugars went low. I remember having my Myoclonic seizures which are just muscle jerks, and I took some sugar and was on my phone, sitting on the floor in our basement, with my siblings, waiting for my numbers to come up. The next thing I remember was passing out and then waking up to some random dudes in our basement, and my step mother helping me stand up. Turns out, I went unconsious and had a tonic clonic seizure, then started acting like a tired wacko once they kind of got my attention, without me remembering it, so my step mother called an ambulance. The dudes in our basement were paramedics and firemen (Idk why the firemen showed up, but thats who my step brother they said showed up). I ended up going into the ambulance where a lady was driving, the guy was trying to talk to me to make sure I was alright, and my step mother grabbed me some food and a T-shirt because I bit my tongue when I fell face first and I had blood on my sweater, and she came in the ambulance with me (Her mother was there to watch the other kids). So I was in a hospital that I'm usually taken to for this stuff, and they were giving me sugar stuff through an IV. My step mother stayed with me until my mom came to swap out with her (Only one parent allowed in per patient at a time). I ended up getting out at 2am on friday and my mom drove me back to my step mother's house to get some sleep. 

Apparently while I was being a wacko, I latched onto my step mother's arm and she had to pry me off, and then I just randomlt pulled at her pants. 

Apparently my 3yo half sister was there, somehow knows what a seizure is, and will tell you that I had a seizure and will tell you the sounds I make during those seizures. My muscles are sore as hell, but now I might get a reason out of gym lmao.

\[54/M\] Heres a strange one: I recently developed Asymmetrical Hyperhidrosis where I sweat only on the left side of my body (face/neck/torso -- not sure about legs).  When I work out or even heat up my clothes are dry on one side and soaked on the other. I have always been a heavy sweater, but now only on half of my body.

Hello everyone! Im 20 F and suffering from a weak esophagus and 3 cm hiatal hernia. I am receiving the toupet fundoplication tomorrow morning. Im ready to be able to eat pizza with my friends and not writhe trying to sleep later, or be able to look under my bed for something without bile leaking into my mouth. 

Ive been through lots of testing and its been determined I REALLY need this surgery. My grandmother actually had the same surgery done by the same surgeon 2 years ago and shes doing amazing, so Im hoping for good outcomes! 

I have to say, I am very nervous about recovery. I know its not good to do this but of course I looked for other peoples opinions and experiences and Ive seen people saying they got worse after surgery, or that the pain was unbearable and they werent normal for months and months afterward. Im a naturally overthinking and anxious person, so any advice or words of encouragement would be so appreciated!!!

Ill update tomorrow afterwards when I can and tell you all my experience :))

UPDATE #1: 

Hi guys! Ive been post-op I think around 8-10 hours Im not sure, but we started about 2.5 hrs late cuz of a delay with his other patient. I was told the surgery went well and everything was successful. Yay! When I woke up I was very out of it but I will warn you all, its probably different for everyone, but the pain from the gas they pump in was excruciating. Definitely a 9 on the pain scale. Its already gone down to maybe a 4, but it was the worst pain Ive ever felt for a little while there. None of the pain came from the actual surgery so thats good and bad in my opinion haha.

Its about 2 am where Im at and Ive been sleeping on and off. Ive had the tiniest bit of water and lukewarm chicken broth which was actually amazing lmao. Theyve had to give me lots of good pain meds and some nausea meds occasionally but other than that Ive been fine. Ive been up to the bathroom 3 times and it gets easier every time. However, it is a little strange to pee cuz you can feel your stomach spam a little!! (It doesnt hurt at all and you can barely feel it, its just weird!) 

I cant really bend down yet at all and I still have some dull achy pain in my shoulders but hopefully that will subside soon. Ill let you guys know any other updates I have!!!

MINI UPDATE: 
Hey guys. Woke up around 4:30 and the shoulder pain was back. 5:30 got more morphine. Morphine is nice. Still hurts like a bitch tho


**UPDATE 8/20/2022**
Hey everyone. I am so sorry I never continued updating this thread. I switched reddit accounts so I never even saw how many people were asking about my experience! Here's what I can tell you after about 8 months.

The recovery was HARD. Very very difficult, but worth it. It was about 3 months before I got back to eating completely normally, but since then I've only had 2 or 3 episodes of something getting stuck, and it usually passes within minutes, and even those 2 or 3 happened months ago. Something not a lot of people talk about with the recovery is lack of energy. It was probably a month or more before I had enough energy to not nap at all during the day, and it was about until I could eat completely normally that I had a normal amount of energy.

The pain with the recovery was pretty intense for the first week or so, then eventually subsided. The shoulder pain from the gas right after the surgery was some of the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life, but it gets a lot better once you walk it off. However, that was difficult too. It was pretty difficult to do literally anything other than lay down or sit up on pillows and sleep. I had to have help sitting up for about a week. All of this stuff from the first week, however, subsided pretty quickly as I started to be able to get back to normal life.

Since I woke up from the surgery, I haven't had a single GERD/acid reflux issue. The surgery DOES work (for most and for me), and it DOES work IMMEDIATELY. It was life changing. I didn't even know most people's stomach didn't burn painfully when they were hungry; I thought that was normal until after this surgery.

As for weight loss, I weighed about 177 when I got the surgery, and now I weigh about 130. Most of the weight loss can be attributed to this surgery and the liquid diet and eating much smaller portions because your stomach is a third smaller, however in my personal experience I also started taking a stimulant Vyvanse for my ADHD which makes me eat a LOT less and also have impulse control over my snacking. I still believe you will lose a good bit of weight just from the surgery alone no matter who you are because of the liquid diet and eating smaller portions (ESPECIALLY the smaller portions, I can hardly eat anything at one time anymore, but I am hungry more times in a day because of this).

What I want everyone to know about this surgery that not a lot of people talk about is that, in my experience, it is more of a trade-off than a fix. Yes, I haven't had a single issue with GERD since I woke up afterward, but I also have not been able to expel gas from my system or have a normal bowel movement since then either. I have been taking the absolute maximum strength Gas X and Metamucil every morning and every night since my last surgery follow up appointment because these issues never got better. If I miss one dose of either of these supplements, it will take 2 days or more to get regular again. And the supplements don't completely fix it. I also eat very very small amounts, which was nice at first cuz I needed to lose weight, but now that I'm at a healthy weight it's kinda aggravating eating such small amounts many times a day to satiate hunger, but that's probably the least significant issue I've had.

Another thing I've encountered that I haven't heard much about is sugar intolerance. I have a much harder time consuming sugar now, especially in drinks. I can't drink any drink with any more than maybe 20% of your daily value of sugar because it hurts my stomach so bad. I just turned 21 in February and I have come to terms with the fact that my drink choices are very limited due to the fact that carbonation and sugar make me sick. Simple syrup, for example, will make my stomach hurt so bad I have to go home and go to bed if I even have just a few sips. It sucks, but it's worth it to have to make some lifestyle changes to get rid of the acid reflux. I will say though, the carbonation issues have gotten less and less as time has gone on. I can even drink seltzers now (as long as they don't have lots of sugar, of course). 

I am also unable, of course, to vomit. I haven't had anything come up at all since then. It's tried a few times though, and let me tell you, it sucks! In my personal experience, the few times my body has tried to make me throw up, I've been stuck retching for up to an hour or more. It's very painful, and it will keep going for a long time. I contracted a stomach virus a few months ago and had to go to the hospital because I kept uncontrollably retching to the point I couldn't breathe and almost passed out. It was very scary, but that was only 1 time, and after that I asked for a stronger anti-nausea pill (I take Zofran now) and I have it on me AT ALL TIMES, just like my inhaler. I'd suggest if you feel at all like you might be sick, TAKE IT! Other than those few times though, the inability to throw up hasn't been much of a issue.

Oh, also as a side note, I still can't lift things that are very heavy/awkward without it hurting the site. Also the scars healed up pretty well. Still visible of course, but I'm covered in scars from being a wild child and working in a kitchen (lol) so I don't really care about them, but for anyone that does, I don't think they go away for a while.

Overall, I'm very very glad, even/especially at my young age, that I chose to have this surgery. I was in so much pain and couldn't do a lot of things normal people my age could because it hurt me so bad/made me sick. I couldn't sleep without my whole bed being propped up, I couldn't eat 4 hours before bed, I couldn't eat anything spicy or tomato without completely regretting it later, etc. It absolutely changed my life. The recovery was hell, I had to make some lifestyle changes, I still can't do some things ""normal"" people my age can do, but it's worlds better than what I was dealing with. I could immediately sleep at any elevation without it burning and choking on bile. I can eat pretty much any food I want (except for much sugar, but that's okay). I can eat right before bed if I want, I can eat spicy food all day long, I can eat Mexican, etc.! I have so much more freedom! It still does cost 1. money of course, and 2. still a little freedom. You have to be careful to take care of it well. You want it to last as long as possible, and you don't want to hurt yourself.

I'm so sorry this update didn't come out sooner. I hope this can help many many people in making a decision!!! Peace and love to all my GERD homies <3

**TL;DR: I'm very happy with my decision to go through with the surgery and most people would benefit from it I believe. However, there are many trade-offs/nuances I wish I had been more aware of. My quality of life is worlds better after this surgery and I would encourage everyone who qualifies to discuss it with your doctors and specialists, and don't be afraid of the recovery. It's so worth it!**"

Its tolerable now but I still sound froggy/horse and its uncomfortable, especially talking to people. Ive tried OTC lozenges, mouth sprays, and even a humidifier at night but nothing seems to work 

Does anyone have suggestions to ease these side effects (most importantly my dry throat)?

This medication has changed my life I really want to stay on it  - Open to suggestions as well thank you and happy holidays."

Hi all,

F40 - suffering since 4 years but always untreated sinus issues..

I got sick about four yrs ago. Some kind of flu which progressed to septic shock and from there, my health went down hill.

It started with vertigo and then visual issues such as double vision. I was, from this diagnosed with Vestibular migraine. Though, no genetic predisposition is known and I did not even have a regular headache prior.

From there, I was diagnosed with POTS syndrome due to head pressure and a variety of other symdome.

I am generally based in Melbourne, Australia but I am from Ireland.

This is important as, four yrs prior, I was actually on a flight from Melbourne to Dublin when I picked up a virus and so, I was treated in Dublin.

On discharge, I noticed my notes said, 'deviated septum with sinusitis left nostril.

Due to issues with' vestibular migraines ' and also TMDj, I have frequent CT scans and always, literally always, there is a sinus infection in the left nasal cavity which is much smaller than the right.

About a week ago, I had another infection and yet again, the dentists pointed out my left nostril on scan, saying wow, you really are inflamed in that left nostril.

Since that time I have had ear pain, vertigo, face pain and itch inside nose..

It got me thinking if all my problems or at least some, could be related to that left nostril.

Just throwing it out there but can anyone relate?

Thank you"

By having two long sleeves the sun hits the first one instead of your skin. Having two long sleeves creates an air conditioning effect through an evaporation. Plus you get to prevent sun burns, bug bites, and have sleeves to wipe face sweat.


EDIT: Sometimes just one long sleeve suffices. In my experience when it's over 90° and I can expect to be outside for a few hours or more then two long sleeves are a life saver. 

The first long sleeve pulls the sweat from your body, the second layer shades the first layer, both layer shade you from absorbing heat waves.

Hey all, I'm almost 6 years post total thyroidectomy, and since my providers at the time of my TT didn't really share any of this info/it was hard to track down, I wanted to put it out there for others. 

First-- you'll probably want to get on a calcium supplement. That part I was told. How much calcium I wasn't told, but eventually found out from a pharmacist to go a bit above the recommended for your age/assigned sex at birth. Normally my recommended would be 1000mg, but because of the TT, it's 1200mg. 

Second-- wait at least 4 hours after taking your thyroid hormone replacement before taking a calcium supplement. Also was told that, also something everyone here probably already knows. 

Third-- our bodies can only absorb around 500mg of calcium in one go. 

Fourth-- if you've had a TT, your body will absorb calcium citrate more effectively than calcium carbonate. I learned this literally a month ago from a PCP who doesn't specialize in thyroid health, and I'd love to know why my endocrinologist never told me. 

Now, all of the above led me to be interested in the Citracal slow release, as it's 1200mg, but released slowly so you can take it once a day and still get all of it. My only issue was that I couldn't find anywhere that said how long it took to fully release. I was worried that if it took too long, it would prevent my levothyroxine from absorbing the next day. I couldn't find the answer online, but finally called their questions line today and found out it's 8 hours. 

Obviously I'm not a medical provider, I just want more of us to have access to this info, especially since a lot of us have worked with medical providers that don't give us all of the information we need.

This lil baby also help your cells regenerate super duper fast. Lovely eh? Each day your immune system is busy torturing your connective tissues. Maybe swallowing this will increase the level of regeneration?
2. **Magnesium:** Magnesium is required for energy production, protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood sugar control and IDK what else. Hell let's just say it's .44 magnum. BANG! It will help you calm the hell outta your tense muscles. Cramps, spams will decrease. You take anti-inflammatory, but see those pills will always make your colon unhappy. Magnesium will make you poop easily. Be careful with the dosage, or your toilet might explode.
3. **Vitamin C:**  One sneeze and your spine hates you. I know. I been there. You don't even wanna sneeze sometimes. Well Vitamin C will keep cold far away. No runny nose. No sneeze. No OUCH! If you love lemonade you are probably lucky. But making homemade lemon water ain't bad either. Good source.
4. **Vitamin D3:** Either the Sun went on a vacation or I don't go out much. Either way Vitamin D3 is lacking in you and me and our brother from a different mother too. Vit D is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps your body absorb calcium and phosphorus. Having the right amount of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus is important for your bones. Especially those of you taking steroids for pain. Also it improves muscle function and immunity. You can probably search all about the goodness of The Sun. But too much exposure might lead to skin cancer. So Vit D in food and supplement is better.
5. **Calcium:** You need Vit D to absorb the calcium. But what's even better is see you will less likely suffer from acidity problems due to drugs you take or spicy food whatever. Be careful those of you senior. It can mess with your kidney if the dosage is way too much. So call your doctor like I said. Otherwise, if milk is no problem for you, no lactose intolerant then just go drink milk like a baby.
6. **Zinc:** Faster metabolism = less weight. Less weight = less stress to your joints. Overall zinc will improve your metabolism. Zinc is also good for testosterone production so for men Zinc is a must. I don't have to say more about Testosterone. It's life's nectar.
7. **Selenium:**  Selenium is a nutrient that plays a key role in maintaining thyroid hormone metabolism and DNA synthesis and protecting the body from oxidative damage and infection. You need this for metabolism once again and this will help with aging related problems to some degree. Don't need too much of it, can find in multi-vitamin tablets.
8. **Melatonin:** Shitty sleep = shitty recovery. Back pain = Shitty sleep. Thanks to our modern age, we are surrounded by screens which emit light messing up with our sleep cycle. Melatonin is a hormone primarily released by the pineal gland at night, and has long been associated with control of the sleep wake cycle. As a dietary supplement, it is often used for the short term treatment of insomnia. Some studies shows it can act as a painkiller too. However mild. Take a 3 mg pill, and break it half, you got 1.5 mg which is all you need for those days you are just having hard to time sleeping due to whatever reason. Trust me, you will wake up good as new. However, melatonin if you abuse it for years, your body might stop producing it all together. So be careful, talk to a doctor, don't use more than a week if you can. Higher dosage will lead to some horror film in your brainz.. ahem. I mean you will get nightmares most likely if you take too much. Don't do that.

Without these I probably couldn't weight lift during winter as my joints for some reason hate cold.

First of all, most of you have soreness after waking up. Try to rub your feet against the bed sheet as much as you can. Fold your legs up and down. If you can sit straight and move your arms a bit. Getting up without using your hands is almost impossible for some of you with SI joint inflammation, but for lucky ones try to do some light crunches, situps. Warm up, 8 reps, working set, reps... slowly.

No force. You need all the lovin' in the morning to decrease the cranky bastard in your joints!

For those of you with SI joint problems, take a large pillow, hug it tightly and try to lay down on it, then slowly one leg down on the floor from bed, both hands push till your torso is straight, put down another leg. There you go, you are down and steady like The Terminator!

Don't move already. Keep standing. If you have a glass of water nearby drink it. At least stand straight for 30 secs to 1 minute then move on. Your muscles are just getting ready.

***Now comes the magic pills. Well I will list some vitamins and minerals and why they are important for you. When taking these don't jump straight forward to the highest dosage.***

Talk to your doctor, call him. All you wanna know is the okay dosage for the particular supplement, I doubt doc would get mad!

4. **Vitamin D3:** Either the Sun went on a vacation or I don't go out much. Either way Vitamin D3 is lacking in you and me and our brother from a different mother too. Vit D is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps your body absorb calcium and phosphorus. Having the right amount of vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus is important for your bones. Especially those of you taking steroids for pain. Also it improves muscle function and immunity. You can probably search all about the goodness of The Sun. But too much exposure might lead to skin cancer. So Vit D in food and supplement is better.
5. **Calcium:** You need Vit D to absorb the calcium. But what's even better is see you will less likely suffer from acidity problems due to drugs you take or spicy food whatever. Be careful those of you senior. It can mess with your kidney if the dosage is way too much. So call your doctor like I said. Otherwise, if milk is no problem for you, no lactose intolerant then just go drink milk like a baby.
6. **Zinc:** Faster metabolism = less weight. Less weight = less stress to your joints. Overall zinc will improve your metabolism. Zinc is also good for testosterone production so for men Zinc is a must. I don't have to say more about Testosterone. It's life's nectar.
7. **Selenium:**  Selenium is a nutrient that plays a key role in maintaining thyroid hormone metabolism and DNA synthesis and protecting the body from oxidative damage and infection. You need this for metabolism once again and this will help with aging related problems to some degree. Don't need too much of it, can find in multi-vitamin tablets.
8. **Melatonin:** Shitty sleep = shitty recovery. Back pain = Shitty sleep. Thanks to our modern age, we are surrounded by screens which emit light messing up with our sleep cycle. Melatonin is a hormone primarily released by the pineal gland at night, and has long been associated with control of the sleep wake cycle. As a dietary supplement, it is often used for the short term treatment of insomnia. Some studies shows it can act as a painkiller too. However mild. Take a 3 mg pill, and break it half, you got 1.5 mg which is all you need for those days you are just having hard to time sleeping due to whatever reason. Trust me, you will wake up good as new. However, melatonin if you abuse it for years, your body might stop producing it all together. So be careful, talk to a doctor, don't use more than a week if you can. Higher dosage will lead to some horror film in your brainz.. ahem. I mean you will get nightmares most likely if you take too much. Don't do that. I personally did that once and had a funny dream, I will tell you if you wanna know.

I personally take all these.

**Trust me, I am not a doctor. ;D**

My diet hmm.. protein shake, a protein rich diet(lean meat such as chicken, soy, almond milk, chickpeas), low in carbs(texmati rice, brown rice, banana), spinach for veggies(i know, sorry) and eat 4-6 times a day. Combined with HIT training is actually helping my illness by making some raw muscles!

# Hope this helps you!

Hey all, I'm almost 6 years post total thyroidectomy, and since my providers at the time of my TT didn't really share any of this info/it was hard to track down, I wanted to put it out there for others. 

First-- you'll probably want to get on a calcium supplement. That part I was told. How much calcium I wasn't told, but eventually found out from a pharmacist to go a bit above the recommended for your age/assigned sex at birth. Normally my recommended would be 1000mg, but because of the TT, it's 1200mg. 

Second-- wait at least 4 hours after taking your thyroid hormone replacement before taking a calcium supplement. Also was told that, also something everyone here probably already knows. 

Third-- our bodies can only absorb around 500mg of calcium in one go. 

Fourth-- if you've had a TT, your body will absorb calcium citrate more effectively than calcium carbonate. I learned this literally a month ago from a PCP who doesn't specialize in thyroid health, and I'd love to know why my endocrinologist never told me. 

Now, all of the above led me to be interested in the Citracal slow release, as it's 1200mg, but released slowly so you can take it once a day and still get all of it. My only issue was that I couldn't find anywhere that said how long it took to fully release. I was worried that if it took too long, it would prevent my levothyroxine from absorbing the next day. I couldn't find the answer online, but finally called their questions line today and found out it's 8 hours. 

Obviously I'm not a medical provider, I just want more of us to have access to this info, especially since a lot of us have worked with medical providers that don't give us all of the information we need. Also not here to advertise for that brand specifically, I just wanted something convenient enough to take once a day, and figured others might have had the same question!"

This all started about a week ago, I read something about how Pantoprazole has some long term effects on your body that honestly arent too stellar so I decided to just stop taking it (I was taking 40mg Pantoprazole once a day or twice if needed)
Anyway, during this time Ive been feeling the WORST symptoms Ive ever experienced. Tons of acid in my throat, stomach and chest pain, nausea, diarrhea, constipation. But the worst thing that was happening to me is / was the fluttering in my chest or palpitations possibly? Id have a major flair up and the palpitations would continue every 20 seconds or so for a few minutes. 
Now this made my anxiety INSANE and I was constantly having panic attacks due to it. It was a bit of a vicious cycle where symptoms were bad, anxiety was bad and it continued like that for what felt like HOURS.
Today I decided to get back on my PPI because honestly nothing is worth that pain. 

Does anyone have advice? How do you control your anxiety during times like this? Do you experience flare Ups like this ever?"

23 M.

I was born on International Womens Day 98. Soon after delivery I caught a blood infection(neonatal sepsis) . I was in ICU for 11 days, on Gardenal for 3 months.

In August 99 I had a frebile seizure that lasted **25 minutes**.  In December that year , I had a non febrile seizure.I was started on tegretol. Since then I had 5 seizures in 2000 and 6 in 2001.

My seizures usually started half and hour into sleep. I was started on Clobazam . Got 8 seizures in 2002 and 2 in 2004. 

Eventually I was started on Keppra in 06. Since then I had no seizure until in May 2018 due to my schedule I often forgot to take meds. In May 2018, I had a tonic clonic. After which my Keppra was increased from 500/day to 750/day. Now I am seizure free. Been driving motorbike for 5 years now.

The side effects that I have are :

Hello, this question is aimed to the people who have had chronic sinusitis and have made a change to their diet and it's reduced or eliminated their sinus problems.

I've had chronic sinusitis for 3 years and I've had a FESS which helped slightly and I am still attacking the issue from other angles. This is specifically a diet question.

I have tried mediterranean and anti inflammatory diets in the past but never kept a strict pattern for a significant long time (over two weeks). Three days ago I had 6 slices of bread (breakfast toast and 2 lunch sandwiches)  and a heavy pasta dinner and my pain in my face was worse than usual which led to my idea that I may have a gluten intolerance issue. I've read into it and the internet generally says you need 4 to 6 weeks of a diet change to notice a difference. I plan on taking this really seriously this time and going the distance. My questions are; have you done this before? How long did it to take to notice any difference at all? Is the 4 to 6 weeks about right? Any stories or other anecdotes? 

ps. I've been going for two days now and I've powered an insane amount rice noodles so far.

Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I just wanted to reach out to get some opinions on my current situation and what not.

&#x200B;

I've experienced acid reflux for quite a number of years now, on and off, kind of severe at stages, this is over probably about 5-6 years now. I would say the past few years it's even worse.

Lately over the past couple of months, probably 4-5 months, it's been worse, I have been losing weight despite eating, probably some periods in there I probably haven't eaten enough, but my appetite has remained fairly consistent. I have lost about 6 kg in around 4 months now.

I have been in a very stressful situation the past 4-5 months as well, my father had a stroke and then it was found that he had lung cancer, this put a lot of stress/burden on myself as I had to help take care of him and work as well, however I don't want to put this all down to just stress just in case it's not the cause of what's been happening.

I'm having stomach issues fairly consistently, acid reflux, heartburn, indigestion, feelings of hunger.

Symptoms seem to all point to stomach cancer, though I know looking things up doesn't help.

I've been to a doctor, doctor didn't think it was cancer because of my age, I am 33. I have an urgent referral to a specialist however to get checked up, unfortunately it's already been 3 weeks and I haven't heard anything yet.

I don't appear to be gaining weight back, over the past 4 weeks I don't really appear to be losing much more weight and if so, barely any. But I am finding after waking up, I seem to have lost a lot of weight, then kind of put it back on but I think that's mostly water weight.

I kinda feel like it's cancer speeding up my metabolism.

Sometimes I feel like not eating much but that's not not very often at all, but that's due to the stomach issues, but for the most part I am still eating, not getting any food stuck in my throat or any of that.

I don't take NSAIDs as I read that can cause stomach issues, I don't believe I have a H pylori infection, though that hasn't been confirmed yet. So I think the chances of having a stomach ulcer are probably quite slim.

I am not vomiting blood or passing any blood in my stools as well.

&#x200B;

\*\*UPDATE\*\* After 5 weeks from being referred I received a letter to do blood tests. (checked over the tests, fairly sure my GP could have done all these and sent them to the specialist, would have been ideal..)

&#x200B;

\*\*UPDATE\*\* Had a virtual meeting with a specialist, wasn't a GI specialist sadly, was referred to a specialist of general medicine apparently. Wasn't very helpful, was asked to do blood tests, if nothing comes back on blood tests, was advised I will need scans done. Asked about endoscopy, doesn't appear that they want to perform an endoscopy on me. It's taken 6 weeks just to get to the beginning of it all.

**UPDATE** Did some blood tests, confirmed no kidney issues, diabetes or thyroid issues, got a few more blood tests to do then apparently I have to do scans, I mentioned I wanted an endoscopy but was ignored and denied, they don't seem to think I have stomach cancer...

**UPDATE** Some new symptoms have cropped up, stools have been much lighter than normal for 2-3 months now, some cases of diarrhea and constipation as well as sometimes thin stools."

After a full work up to rule out other causes my endocrinologist dropped me from 175 to 150 and my joint pain nearly resolved! I couldn't believe how much better I felt. Less anxiety and more energy. I ended up losing 10lbs unplanned because I was able to be more active. Weight loss pushed me back to undetectable TSH (with recurrence of symptoms) so ready to drop dose again.

Hey guys. I'm 27 years old. I recently went to the GI. Had stomach polyps due to the PPI and a fungal infection due to gluten intolerance which was the reason for my chronic reflux I found out. I also was critically low on B12 which the Dr said was also due to the PPI.

I've been taking PPI's (once a day) for around 2 years OTC like an idiot and stopped now after the Dr said I need to stop gluten and that's helped my reflux almost go away just in a couple weeks.

I came across studies and endless articles yesterday about PPI's causing kidney disease, cancers, bone issues. And I haven't been able to sleep. Especially since I already got several side effects from PPI's. I understand there's a lot of controversy around these studies and was hoping if someone can shed some light on the possibilities of my kidney's getting messed up or gastric cancer after daily use for 2 years.

Much appreciated.

Edit: I forgot to mention I'm a lifelong vegetarian and that my B12 was always on the lower end. But the GI was the first doctor to tell me it was critically low. So perhaps the B12 wasn't so much due to the PPI."

24F diagnosed with AS in late 2019, with two sisters also diagnosed with AS and on Humira. Older sister is HLA-B27 positive, twin sister and I are HLA-B27 negative.  

After I was diagnosed in 2019, my rheumatologist prescribed me Celebrex, which didn't really help with controlling my symptoms and I was then switched to Naproxen. Naproxen did seem to provide slight improvement but I was worried about the potential gastric issues of taking it long-term and started Humira in September 2020. 

I was initially injecting humira every 2 weeks, but felt very little to no relief. Earlier this year, I also dealt with costochondritis and bursitis so my doctor  had me switch to doing my injections every 12 days, again with little improvement. I am now currently taking 15mg of methotrexate weekly on top of the humira but still experience pretty bad lower back pain in the mornings on top of right SI pain that worsens when I move in bed or stand up, which sometimes spreads down my entire leg. My doctor is aware of this, but has instructed me to just take naproxen at night time or as needed. 

However, my pharmacist informed me that methotrexate and naproxen may have adverse interactions with one another, so I have been too scared to take naproxen on the weekends so I experience more pain than on other days.

Humira has helped my older sister go into remission for nearly 3 years with few flare ups and she noticed relief almost immediately after she started injections. I was hopeful that I would experience similar results, but now I'm wondering whether I should request a new treatment plan now that I'm approaching one year on Humira. The main improvement that I have noticed was that I am no longer experiencing severe flare ups that prevent me from walking or getting out of bed. 

Note: I am currently following a low carb diet to help control inflammation and other medical issues, as directed by my endo. 

Do you think it's appropriate to ask for a different treatment plan? For reference, I'm from Toronto, Canada and am unfamiliar with the other biologics that are currently available for this condition. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

-No skinny jeans!! Aggravates lower body/private area sweating worse than any other pant. Try leggings (cotton/spandex blend works great)/ baggier jeans, skirts (denim skirts are great, sometimes thin skirts can end in a puddle of sweat on a chair ).

-Cotton sports bras > underwire bras. I barely notice the sweat when I wear a thinner cotton bra. Or ditch the bra tbh (sooo much more comfortable to not have a sweaty blob stuck to your chest all day). Also cotton underwear. 

- Something I find helps with stomach and underarm sweat immensely is a button up sweater vs. a regular pullover sweater, similarly a zip-up hoodie vs. a regular sweatshirt. Usually zipped/buttoned halfway with a thin tanktop underneath is ideal for me (I avoid any T-shirts in general because my underarms soak them so fast and its uncomfortable and distracting), GREAT breathability and still super cute and fashionable.
